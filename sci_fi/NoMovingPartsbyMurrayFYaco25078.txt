NO MOVING PARTS By MURRAY F. YACO ILLUSTRATED by GRAYAM We call them trouble-shooters . They called ‘ em Gypsies . Either way , they were hep to that whole bit about .... Hansen was sitting at the control board in the single building on Communications Relay Station 43. 4SC , when the emergency light flashed on for the first time in two hundred years . With textbook-recommended swiftness , he located the position of the ship sending the call , identified the ship and the name of its captain , and made contact . “ This is Hansen on 43. 4SC . Put me through to Captain Fromer. ” “ Fromer here , ” said an incredible deep voice , “ what the devil do you want ? ” “ What do I want ? ” asked the astonished Hansen . “ It was you , sir , who sent the emergency call. ” “ I did no such thing , ” said Fromer with great certainty . “ But the light flashed — ” “ How long have you been out of school ? ” Fromer asked . “ Almost a year , sir , but that does n't change the fact that — ” “ That you 're imagining things and that you 've been sitting on that asteroid hoping that something would happen to break the monotony . Now leave me the hell alone or I 'll put you on report. ” “ Now look here , ” Hansen began , practically beside himself with frustration , “ I saw that emergency light go on . Maybe it was activated automatically when something went out of order on your ship. ” “ I do n't allow emergencies on the Euclid Queen , ” said Fromer with growing anger . “ Now , if you do n't — ” Hansen spared himself the indignity of being cut off . He broke contact himself . He sighed , reached for a book entitled Emergency Procedure Rules , and settled back in his chair . Fifteen minutes later the emergency light flashed on for the second time in two hundred years . With its red glow illuminating his freckled excited face , Hansen triumphantly placed another call to the Euclid Queen . “ This is Hansen on 43. 4SC . Let me speak to Captain Fromer , please. ” “ Er — the Captain has asked me to contact you . I 'm the navigator . I was just about to call you . We have a small problem that — ” “ I 'll speak to the Captain , ” Hansen repeated grimly . “ Now see here . I 'm perfectly capable of handling this situation . Actually , it 's hardly even an emergency . You were , it seems , signaled automatically when — ” “ If you 'll check your emergency procedures , ” Hansen said , holding his thumb in the Rule Book , “ you 'll note that the Relay Station Attendant contacts the Captain personally during all emergencies . Of course , if you want to violate — ” “ Look , old man , ” said the navigator , now sounding on the verge of tears , “ try to realize the spot I 'm in . Fromer has ordered me to handle this thing without his assistance . He seems to feel that you have a grudge of some kind — ” “ If you do n't put me in touch with Captain Fromer in five minutes , I 'll put through a call to Sector Headquarters. ” Hansen signaled off contact . If he knew nothing else about the situation , he knew that he had the upper hand . Five minutes later Captain Fromer called him back . “ I am calling in accordance with emergency procedures , ” Fromer said between clinched teeth . “ The situation is this : We are reporting an emergency — ” “ What class emergency ? ” Hansen interrupted . “ Class ? ” asked Fromer , obviously caught off guard . “ Yes , Captain . There are three classes of emergencies . Major class , which would include death and injury . Mechanical class , including malfunction of Hegler units and such . And General class — ” “ Yes , yes , of course , General class by all means , ” Fromer said hurriedly . “ You see , it 's hardly even an emergency . We — ” “ Just what is the nature of the trouble , Captain ? ” “ Why , uh , well it seems that we were doing a preliminary landing procedure check , and ... ” “ Yes , go on. ” “ Why , er , it seems that we can n't get the door open. ” It was Hansen 's turn to be taken aback . “ You 're pulling my leg , sir. ” “ I most certainly am not , ” Captain Fromer said emphatically . “ You really mean that you can n't open the door ? ” “ I 'm afraid so . Something 's wrong with the mechanism . Our technical staff has never encountered a problem like this , and they advise me that any attempt at repair might possibly result in the opposite situation. ” “ You mean not being able to get the door closed ? ” “ Precisely . In other words , we can n't land. ” “ I see . Then I 'm afraid there 's nothing I can do except advise Sector Headquarters to send an emergency repair crew. ” Captain Fromer sighed . “ I 'm afraid so , too . How long will it take for a message to get there with your transmitting equipment ? ” “ Two days , Captain . At a guess , there 'll be a ship alongside within the week . You 'll be maintaining your present position , I assume ? ” “ Oh , we 'll be here , all right , ” Fromer said bitterly . Then he cut contact . As the single occupant of a large asteroid with nothing but time and boredom on his hands , Hansen was enjoying the whole situation immensely . He allowed himself the luxury of several dozen fantasies in which his name was mentioned prominently in galaxy-wide reports of the episode . He imagined that Captain Fromer was also creating vivid accounts — of quite another sort — that would soon be amusing several hundred billion news-hungry citizens of the Federation . When the repair ship arrived , it came , to Hansen 's astonishment , to the asteroid , and not alongside Fromer 's ship . He soon found out that there was someone else who shared the Captain 's embarrassment . “ I 'm Bullard , ” said a tall , thin , mournful man . “ Mind if I sit ? ” “ Help yourself , ” Hansen waved a hand toward the meager accommodations . He had no idea why a Senior Engineer was being so deferential , but he enjoyed the feeling of power . “ You 're probably wondering about a lot of things , ” Bullard began sadly . “ Frankly , we do n't have any ideas about how we can fix Captain Fromer 's door. ” He waited to let that sink in . Then he continued : “ It took us three days back at the base to find out that when these ships were built , almost five hundred years ago , nobody bothered to include detail drawings of the door mechanism. ” “ But why ? You certainly know how to build — ” “ We know how to build Star Class ships , sure . We 've built a few in the past century or two . There 's never been need for replacement , really . These ships are designed to last forever . The original fleet was conceived to fill the System 's needs for a full thousand years. ” “ But the doors on the few ships that have been built . How — ” “ The ship 's we 've built were exact duplicates of Captain Fromer 's ship — except for the door. ” Bullard 's long face radiated despair . “ No one ever questioned why the door mechanism was n't included in the original plans . We simply designed another type — a different type — of door. ” “ Well , you certainly can find out how this particular door works , can n't you ? ” “ I hope so , ” Bullard said , wringing his hands . “ But we have a couple of other problems . Number one , Captain Fromer has an extremely important passenger aboard . None other than His Exalted Excellency , R ' thagna Bar . He is — or was — on his way home after concluding a treaty of friendship with the President of the Federation. ” Hansen managed a whistle . “ Furthermore , ” Bullard continued , “ His Excellency has to be home soon to get there in time for the mating season . This occurs once in a lifetime , I 'm told , and this is his only chance to continue the ancestral rule — ” “ Wait a minute , ” Hansen said . “ Are you trying to say that you can n't solve a simple problem like getting him home and getting him out of the ship ? You can always cut it in two , can n't you ? ” “ These ships were made to last forever , ” Bullard explained . “ The hull is , of course , pseudo-met , but , not the kind of pseudo-met used for other applications . In short , about the only way you 'll get in that ship is to vaporize it. ” “ But can n't you simply disassemble the door mechanism ? My God , how complicated can it be ? ” “ We 're going to try to do just that , ” Bullard said without a trace of confidence . “ As far as the complication goes , let me say just this : it 's full of moving parts. ” “ What are you getting at ? ” Hansen asked . “ Just this . These ships are perfect mechanisms . There is hardly anything in them that could be called a moving part . Now a door has to open and close . Sure , we devised a simple , safe way to do it a few hundred years after the original fleet was built . The men who designed the original door mechanism felt , perhaps , that it was incongruous to include it in the first place . Maybe that is why they threw away the plans . God knows , it is incongruous . Look ! Here 's a photo we took of one in a ship back at base. ” Hansen scanned the photograph . It was a meaningless jumble . He handed it back . “ Well , make yourself at home . I 'm afraid that the only thing I can help with will be radio communication to Captain Fromer 's ship. ” “ Good enough , ” Bullard said . “ I 'm expecting someone else tomorrow . After you bring him down , feel free to drop over and see me anytime. ” Bullard went back to his ship , and Hansen went to bed . He dreamed of His Exalted Excellency R ' thagna Bar , growing angrier day by day as the time of mating came closer . In his dream he suddenly came upon a magnificent solution to the problem , a solution involving a telepathic system of fertilization . He woke up before he had completely worked out the details . Bullard 's friend arrived the same morning . He was a small , dark active little man whom Hansen immediately disliked . “ Meet Dr. Quemos , ” Bullard said when Hansen dropped in on them . “ Dr. Quemos is a specialist in the history of technology . He thinks he knows how our cute little door mechanism is made. ” “ Ca n't say for sure , ” Quemos said , “ but I 'd guess that those components are made of metal — real metal. ” “ I thought that metal was used only in jewelry , ” Hansen said . Dr. Quemos grinned slyly . “ That 's what most people think . Actually , refined metal of various types was used in large masses , formed masses , for thousands of years . Historically speaking , the pseudo-mets are relatively new. ” “ It 's difficult to imagine metal functioning as machinery , ” Hansen mused . “ And you say that this door mechanism has moving parts , lots of them ? ” “ Moving parts are nothing to be afraid of , ” Quemos said . “ Here , look at this. ” He put something small on the table , much in the manner of a young boy dropping a garter snake in the midst of school girls . Bullard and Hansen crowded around . “ Now , take turns , ” said Quemos sharply , “ and do n't drop it . It 's priceless , I assure you. ” The ancient wrist watch with its transparent back was passed from hand to hand . “ Frightening little monster , is n't it , ” Bullard said . “ Those small round wheels are called gears , ” elucidated Quemos , “ one gear turns another , which turns another , and so on . I rather imagine that your door is operated on some similar principle. ” “ I seem to be the one who asks all the schoolboy questions , ” Hansen began , “ would somebody tell me why Captain Fromer does n't take His Excellency to his home planet , land the ship , and then let his technical staff tear off the door mechanism ? ” “ We 've gone through that , ” Bullard said wearily . “ Unfortunately we need special tools . And there 's no way to get them into the ship. ” “ Can I speak to Captain Fromer ? ” Quemos asked . “ Right away , ” Hansen said . He pressed his hand in various patterns on his belt . “ This is Hansen . Let us talk to Captain Fromer , please. ” “ Fromer here . Who is it ? ” “ Dr. Quemos speaking . How is your passenger ? ” “ My passenger is fine . But he keeps telling me that he is very anxious to plant his seed . When can you get us out of here ? ” “ Plant his seed ? ” said Quemos . “ There 's nothing salacious about this , I 've been assured . He simply has a biological craving at this time in his life to — to plant his seed. ” “ I got problems like that , too , ” Bullard said , “ but I do n't go around telling everybody. ” “ Stop clowning , ” Fromer snapped , “ you guys better find a way to fix this damn door or you 'll have a galactic war on your hands . Anybody have any ideas yet ? ” “ We 're sure that the door mechanism is made of metal , ” Quemos said , “ and the construction is probably based on the principal of a worm gear. ” “ A what ? ” “ A worm gear , Captain , ” Quemos said patiently . “ It 's an ancient metal device that was sometimes used for closing large doors . There is also the possibility that the door is closed and opened by dogs . These seem to have been used , at least , to operate doors of undersea crafts . Although we 're not quite certain about the function of dogs. ” The captain maintained a stony silence . “ Also , ” Quemos continued , “ we have unearthed , so to speak , a reference to a metal component called a babbitt — ” “ Now see here ! ” Captain Fromer roared , “ who do you think you 're kidding with this talk about worms , dogs and rabbits — ” “ Babbitts , Captain , babbitts ! Perhaps a type of bearing . Anyway , we 're at work on the problem , I assure you. ” Quemos motioned to Hansen that he was through talking . During the next three days , Hansen twice visited Bullard and Quemos . On each occasion , he found the two men in trance-like conditions , ostensibly thinking through the problem that they had been assigned to solve , but more probably , Hansen guessed , brooding about the reaction of Sector Headquarters to their daily progress reports which Hansen had been relaying for them . Hansen had only sympathy for the people back at Sector Headquarters , for if these two experts were the Galaxy 's two top trouble-shooters , the Federation , was not , as Hansen put it to himself , in very good shape to fight a war with one hundred billion enraged citizens who worshiped His Exalted Excellency R ' thagna Bar almost as much as they did his seed . Hansen went back to his reading , only to be interrupted with increasing frequency by message transmissions from an increasingly alarmed Sector Headquarters . Most messages were addressed to Bullard , and were bravely designed to disguise the senders ’ hysteria , while at the same time urging Bullard on to more magnificent efforts . A few messages , fairly representative of the state of affairs as time wore on reflected an increasing suspicion on the part of Sector Headquarters that Quemos and Bullard , although certainly tops in their fields , were not tops enough .

COLOR ON STOMACH PINK AND YELLOW WITH BLUE SQUARES . THIS SIGNIFICANT ? QUEMOS It went on like this for several more days . Hansen , at first amused , was now alarmed and completely convinced that both Quemos and Bullard were thoroughly useless . The messages were his only source of information , since both “ experts ” were too immersed in their work to talk with him . As his alarm grew , he decided that he might at least try to strike up a friendship with someone on board Captain Fromer 's sealed ship — someone who might have something comforting to report . He called up the ship 's navigator . “ This is Hansen . How 're things going up there ? ” “ Ha ! ” “ What 's that mean ? Good or bad ? ” “ It means , ” the navigator said , while yawning , “ that things are falling apart rapidly . In fact , in a day or two I do n't think it 'll make much difference whether or not they open that damn door. ” “ You , er , care to fill me in ? ” “ Why not ? ” said the navigator , with the voice of a man who knows that it is too late for anything to matter . “ The members of the crew are divided into two factions . It appears that our physician has rallied half the crew to support his medical contention that our exhalted passenger belongs in the refrigerator . The good captain , with some justice , one must admit , thinks that he is in command of the ship , and prefers to believe that R ' thagna Bar belongs out of the refrigerator. ” “ Who seems to be winning the argument ? ” “ Argument ? There 's no argument , old man — it 's open warfare . No weapons aboard , of course , but the two teams are grappling up and down the corridors and shuttling our exhalted passenger in and out of the ice box about four times each hour . Quite a sight , really . Right now he 's in the refrigerator , but the other team — ” “ Let me know who 's ahead from time to time , will you ? ” Hansen heard himself say . “ Glad to oblige , ” the navigator said , yawning again . “ Oh , incidentally , have they sent for help yet ? ” Hansen said with some surprise , “ Why , as a matter of fact , Sector Headquarters is sending some help . How did you know ? ” “ Bound to happen sooner or later , old man . When the going really gets tough they always get around to sending a Gypsy . Only way to get anything done , you know. ” “ I do n't know , ” Hansen said reluctantly . “ Why is it that everyone knows except me ? What , please , is a Gypsy ? ” “ You 're too young to know everything , old man , ” the navigator said . “ You 're especially too young to know about one of the Federation 's best kept secrets . But you might as well , I suppose . The fact is that a Gypsy is a generally vagrant , dirty , thieving , clever scoundrel who will not work , who has absolutely no respect for order or authority , who believes that our institutions are effete and — ” “ But then why — ” “ Patience , patience , ” cautioned the navigator , haughtily , “ if I am to reveal everything I know , I must do it in my own way . The description I just gave you is not necessarily true . It is simply the way that Sector Headquarters feels about Gypsies . Common jealousy , really . It seems that from time to time , our perfect little galactic society spawns men who do n't care to be cast in the common mold . In short , there are a few men around with brains who do n't think that it means very much to wear pretty uniforms or fancy titles. ” “ Uniforms like yours ? ” asked Hansen . “ Precisely , ” the navigator said sadly . “ The truth of the matter is , of course , that I only play at being a navigator . I could n't get this ship off course , if I tried . The same is true with the four engineering officers who stand around watching the Hegler drive units . They occasionally make a ceremonial adjustment , but beyond that , they simply stand around looking pretty. ” “ No moving parts. ” Hansen said . “ No moving brains , if you like . Anyway , a Gypsy has — somewhere along the line — learned how to do things . They 'll take an emergency call about once a year — if they happen to feel like it . Then they charge about half a million credits. ” “ You mean they have an organization , standard rates and — ” “ Heavens no ! ” the navigator said . “ They hate anything that smells like organization . They do n't even specialize in any certain kind of work . One year they 'll be fascinated by sub-nucleonics , the next by horse racing . Very erratic . Ca n't keep attention on any one thing . Heard of one once who engaged in fishing and alcohol drinking . Brilliant mathematician , too . But he 'd only take a call once every three years or so. ” “ For a half million credits a crack , eh ? You could live pretty well for three years on that. ” “ Strangely enough , ” the navigator said thoughtfully , “ they do n't really have any interest in money . If you 'd ever met one , you 'd know that the high fee is sort of a penalty they mete out to everyone else for being so dumb. ” “ Well , one thing for sure , ” Hansen said , “ if Bullard and Quemos are the cream of the crop , I 'm on the side of the Gypsies. ” “ Ah , youth ! ” the navigator said , “ I , too , once had such dreams — ” “ We 'll see about the dreams , ” Hansen said , almost menacingly , “ I did n't spend six years in that damn school just to sit around in a pretty uniform for the rest of my life. ” “ Oh , you 'll get used to it . In fact , you 'll like it after a while . The home leaves . The fuss your friends will make over you when you step off the ship . The regular and automatic promotions in grade with the extra gold band added to your sleeve ; the move from one outpost to an always larger installation . You 'll never do much , of course , but why should you ? After all , there are n't any moving parts. ” Hansen cut the communicator off . He stood there for a moment , feeling depressed and betrayed . Automatically he reached down and flicked imaginary dust from his blue sleeve with its narrow solitary gold band . Ten minutes later the Gypsy 's ship signaled for landing . The man who walked into Hansen 's control room was hardly the ogre he had been prepared for . He looked , Hansen was later to reflect , like Santa Claus with muscles in place of the fat . Wearing an almost unheard of beard and dressed in rough clothes , he walked across the room and made short work of the usual formalities . “ Name 's Candle , ” said the man . “ Where 's those two phonies I 'm supposed to replace ? ” “ You 'll have to go suit up and go back through the airlock , ” Hansen said , motioning to the door . “ They 're in their ship . It 's the one next to yours . Want me to tell them you 're on your way over ? ” “ Hell , no , ” said Candle , grinning , “ I 'll surprise ‘ em . Now , suppose you and me sit down and have a little chat. ” They sat and Candle pumped Hansen of everything he knew about the entire situation . An hour later , Hansen felt almost as if he had been had . “ Is that all ? ” he asked , wearily . “ I got the facts , ” Candle said . “ Now let 's go throw those experts out. ” It was n't quite that simple . Neither Bullard nor Quemos had any intention of simply clearing out . “ Who the hell you think you are , ” Bullard said , “ to come over here and order us off ? We did n't even ask for help . And , God knows , you could n't supply it anyway. ” Bullard , with evident distaste , ran his eyes up and down Candle 's clothing . Dr. Quemos had some ideas , too . “ Letter of authority or no letter of authority , ” Quemos said , pointing a manicured forefinger at the paper in Candle 's hand , “ you 'll ruin everything ! You have no idea what you 're up against . We 've spent weeks working this thing out — ” Candle grinned . “ What 've you worked out ? ” “ Why — why we know that this is a metal double enveloping worm gear. ” “ Wrong , ” Candle said . “ It 's a single enveloping worm gear . It 's made of steel with an aluminum alloy wheel gear and the two parts have corroded and stuck . The whole mechanism was originally designed for submarines. ” Quemos started to say something , then turned and looked at Bullard for reassurance . “ He 's crazy , ” Bullard said , “ he 's making it up as he goes along . How could he possibly know what he 's talking about ? Why , there have n't been any submarines for centuries. ” “ I 'm tired of playing games , ” Candle said , no longer grinning . “ The boy and I have work to do . You two are in the way . You 'll only take up time if I have to work with you and show you what to do . I want you and your ship out of here in half an hour. ” “ Who 's going to make us ? ” Bullard asked with great originality . “ I am. ” Everybody turned around to see who else had entered the conversation . It was Hansen . “ I 'm going to give you fifteen minutes , not thirty , ” Hansen said . “ Then I 'm going to turn the grid power on at full intensity . You can either use it to take off , or sit around and roast alive inside your ship. ” Candle turned and looked at Hansen with new respect . “ Okay ... Let 's go back to your place . I 've still got some things to figure out. ” Quemos was on the verge of hysteria . “ You 're bluffing ! You would n't dare . I 'll report this ! ” Fifteen minutes later , the ship headed for space . Back in Hansen 's room , the two men ate a quick lunch , then sat at the table and talked about Candle 's plans for opening the reluctant door . “ The way I figure it , ” Candle said , “ I think that we can handle the whole thing by radio . Which reminds me , one of these days I 'm going to build a telescreen that will transmit and receive through pseudo-met . Not too difficult really if you approach the problem — ” “ I better get Fromer for you , ” Hansen said hurriedly . “ Fromer here , ” said the bass voice . “ This is Candle . Let me talk to one of your so-called engineering officers. ” “ Who the hell — ” “ Shut up and go get ‘ em , ” Candle growled back . “ And one more yelp out of you and you 'll stay in that ship till you rot. ” There was a pause , then Fromer again , a meek Fromer . “ My chief engineering officer is with me. ” “ Okay . Now get this . Come to think of it , you 'd better record it . Number one : By now you know which component is a worm gear . You will notice , I 'm quite certain , that it engages a large notched wheel . The reason that the door will not move is because at the point where the two gears meet , some of the metal has oxidized . For possible use in future emergencies , I offer this explanation . The entire mechanism is subject to periodic vacuum , when the airlock door is operated . In between times , the mechanism is in the ship 's atmosphere . A condition of lower oxygen content thus obtains around the sealed off area , and such an area is anodic — in other words , corrodible with respect to the surrounding areas in which oxygen has free access . Now , since this door has opened and closed successfully for about five hundred years , it appears that there 's a special reason why it suddenly refuses to function . At a guess , you would experience this condition of intense corrosion only when the aluminum in the wheel gear is exposed to something like sodium hydroxide , and only at the point where it controls the worm gear . Now , has this ship landed recently within such an atmosphere ? ” “ Three weeks ago on Ghortin IV , ” said the weak voice of the engineer . “ We landed to get some pictures of the cloud formations for souvenirs . We dropped on the edge of a large body of water because the view was better — ” Candle shook his head sadly and said , “ You could have avoided trouble by coming in over the land instead of the water . The heat from the ship boiled the water which undoubtedly contained sodium carbonate and calcium hydroxide ; presto , and the air was filled with clouds of sodium hydroxide . “ I suggest that you steer away from all such wicked places in the future . Of course , if you 'd learn how to mine ore , smelt metal , machine components — ” “ First they 'd have to discover fire , ” Hansen said out of the corner of his mouth . “ You 're catching on , son , ” Candle said , out of the corner of his mouth . “ Now , gentlemen , to open the door it will be necessary to break the corroded area apart . This is a large heavy mechanism , as such things go . Since you have no tools heavy enough to batter the corroded area apart , you 'll have to make some. ” “ How can we ? ” Candle sighed . “ I wish I had time to teach you to think , but instead , you 'll have to do as I tell you to do . I think you can probably make a battering ram out of water . You just — do n't interrupt — find or make a long cylindrical container , fill it with water and quick-freeze it in your refrigerator — ” “ But they put R ' thagna Bar in the refrigerator again — ” “ Then I suggest you get him the hell out , ” Candle said . An hour later ten men smashed a half-ton cylinder of ice against the corroded junction of the two gears . Following Candle 's instructions , they next applied the ram to the door itself , which smoothly swung open . “ You 'll find , ” Candle explained , “ that the only damage will be the two missing teeth on the aluminum gear . Since only two teeth are ever in contact at any time , you can simply slide the gear forward and engage it at a point where the teeth are intact . You 'll find , I 'm quite sure , that your door will function properly . Also , Captain , do n't pull out of here until I 'm aboard . I think I 'd like to bring an assistant along , too. ” “ An assistant ? ” Hansen asked . Candle twirled the ends of his long white moustache . “ You , my lad , if you 'd like to go along. ” He pulled a letter from his pocket and fanned the air with it . “ I 'm in complete command of this expedition — at least until His Exalted Excellency gets home to plant his seed. ” Hansen 's face glowed . “ I can n't think of anything I 'd rather do . Let 's get a couple of messages off to Sector Headquarters and get on board ship. ” “ It may not be any joy ride , ” Candle said thoughtfully . “ You probably have n't heard about it , but there 've been a number of ship emergencies in the past few weeks. ” “ Door failures ? ” “ No . At least none that I 've heard of . But at least two Hegler drives have stopped working in mid space. ” “ But , but there 's nothing to stop working — ” Candle 's eyes twinkled . “ No moving parts , eh ? ” Hansen reddened . “ I hope I 've outgrown that silly notion. ” Candle peered into Hansen 's eyes . “ I 'm sure you have . I 'm sure that you will find out a lot more things for yourself . You 're the kind . And we 're going to need a lot of your kind , because failures — failures of so-called perfect mechanisms — are becoming more and more commonplace. ” Candle pointed to the emergency light on the traffic control panel . “ That light will be flashing with more and more frequency in the months to come . But not just to signal trouble in space . If I were a superstitious man , I 'd think that the age of the perfect machine is about to be superseded by the age of the perfect failure — mechanical failures that can n't be explained on any level . I have several friends who 've been in touch with me recently about — ” “ You think that it 's time for a change ? ” Candle smiled quickly . “ That 's the idea . And the truth of the matter is that I am a superstitious man . I really believe , childishly , that the mechanics and motions of the galaxy may turn themselves upsidedown just to snap man out of his apathy and give him some work to do. ” Upsidedown turned out to be a good word . They boarded the big ship an hour later and were respectfully ushered into the presence of Captain Fromer and his staff . “ We 're underway , ” Captain Fromer said . “ We 'll be landing in nine days to deliver R ' thagna Bar home. ” “ How is he ? ” Hansen asked . Fromer shrugged . “ He 's been thawed out , frozen , and thawed out so many times , it 's anybody 's guess . Take a look for yourself. ” Someone pulled back a curtain to expose the recumbent , thawing , steamy form of His Exhalted Excellency R ' thagna Bar . “ Why 's he undressed ? ” Hansen asked . “ Funny , now that you mention it , ” Fromer said , puzzled , “ why is he undressed ? ” “ Fascinating ! Damnedest thing I 've ever seen , ” Candle said . “ What 's so fascinating ? ” Fromer asked suspiciously , moving closer . “ His belly . Never saw anything like it . Those black squares keep appearing and disappearing . If I 've ever seen a truly random pattern — ” “ It started right after they froze him the first time , ” Fromer said disconsolately . “ Fascinating , by Heaven , ” said Candle , who was now down on his hands and knees . “ Look at that top sequence ! Random , yet physiological . I 've got a friend on Bridan III who 'd trade anything for some photos of this . Get me some photo equipment , will you ? ” Captain Fromer ran his hands through what was left of his hair . “ Get him some photo equipment , ” he said to no one in particular , “ and somebody make a truce with that idiot doctor long enough to get me a sedative. ” About this time the ship turned upsidedown . “ But there 's no reason for it ! ” the chief engineer said , running alongside Hansen and Candle . “ The ship can n't turn upsidedown . Everything is functioning perfectly ! ” “ Really not interested , ” said Candle , running down the corridor 's mile-long ceiling . “ Figure something out for yourself for a change. ” “ But what I can n't understand , ” said Hansen , dutifully trotting alongside , “ is how you knew with such certainty how the door mechanism was made . Even if submarines were built like that , you 'd have no way of knowing . There have n't been any submarines in centuries. ” “ The hell you say , ” said Candle , increasing his pace , “ I built one five years ago. ” “ Built one ! What for ? ” “ For the hell of it , and it was a damned good outfit , too . I found plans in an old museum , and had the good sense not to improve on ‘ em . Always remember , boy , that something that really works can n't be improved . That 's why the submarine mechanism was adopted — not adapted — for space . The so-called ‘ better way ’ they 're building ‘ em today is simply a disguise for the fact that most of the gas is gone from our technology. ” “ What happened to the submarine ? ” “ Oh , I traded it to a friend for some falcons . You interested in falconry by any chance ? ” “ Er , no . Ca n't say that I am. ” “ You will be , ” Candle said prophetically , “ you 'll succumb to every enthusiasm man has ever been deviled with . You 're the type . It 's a disease , boy , and the big symptom is n't just curiosity , but the kind of intense curiosity that turns you inside out , devours you and ruins you for orthodoxy. ” Hansen had stopped listening . He was absorbed in trying to recall the pattern he had pressed on his radio belt — a pattern never taught to him — when the ship had suddenly turned upsidedown . Hesitantly , he played with the notion that he had been thinking of the ship traveling upsidedown at the time he impressed the novel pattern on the belt . Now , could that have possibly ... ? The man and the boy disappeared down the ceiling , running at top speed to catch up as the rapidly vanishing form of R ' thagna Bar was dragged and pulled relentlessly toward the refrigerator in a tug of war between the ship 's wild , divided crew . “ Fascinating ! ” said Candle . His eyes , glittering with their own peculiar madness , remained riveted on the distant imperial belly . “ Never saw anything like it ! ” THE END
