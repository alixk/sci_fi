[ Illustration ] IN CASE OF FIRE There are times when a broken tool is better than a sound one , or a twisted personality more useful than a whole one . For instance , a whole beer bottle is n't half the weapon that half a beer bottle is ... By RANDALL GARRETT Illustrated by Martinez In his office apartment , on the top floor of the Terran Embassy Building in Occeq City , Bertrand Malloy leafed casually through the dossiers of the four new men who had been assigned to him . They were typical of the kind of men who were sent to him , he thought . Which meant , as usual , that they were atypical . Every man in the Diplomatic Corps who developed a twitch or a quirk was shipped to Saarkkad IV to work under Bertrand Malloy , Permanent Terran Ambassador to His Utter Munificence , the Occeq of Saarkkad . Take this first one , for instance . Malloy ran his finger down the columns of complex symbolism that showed the complete psychological analysis of the man . Psychopathic paranoia . The man was n't technically insane ; he could be as lucid as the next man most of the time . But he was morbidly suspicious that every man 's hand was turned against him . He trusted no one , and was perpetually on his guard against imaginary plots and persecutions . Number two suffered from some sort of emotional block that left him continually on the horns of one dilemma or another . He was psychologically incapable of making a decision if he were faced with two or more possible alternatives of any major importance . Number three ... Malloy sighed and pushed the dossiers away from him . No two men were alike , and yet there sometimes seemed to be an eternal sameness about all men . He considered himself an individual , for instance , but was n't the basic similarity there , after all ? He was — how old ? He glanced at the Earth calendar dial that was automatically correlated with the Saarkkadic calendar just above it . Fifty-nine next week . Fifty-nine years old . And what did he have to show for it besides flabby muscles , sagging skin , a wrinkled face , and gray hair ? Well , he had an excellent record in the Corps , if nothing else . One of the top men in his field . And he had his memories of Diane , dead these ten years , but still beautiful and alive in his recollections . And — he grinned softly to himself — he had Saarkkad . He glanced up at the ceiling , and mentally allowed his gaze to penetrate it to the blue sky beyond it . Out there was the terrible emptiness of interstellar space — a great , yawning , infinite chasm capable of swallowing men , ships , planets , suns , and whole galaxies without filling its insatiable void . Malloy closed his eyes . Somewhere out there , a war was raging . He did n't even like to think of that , but it was necessary to keep it in mind . Somewhere out there , the ships of Earth were ranged against the ships of the alien Karna in the most important war that Mankind had yet fought . And , Malloy knew , his own position was not unimportant in that war . He was not in the battle line , nor even in the major production line , but it was necessary to keep the drug supply lines flowing from Saarkkad , and that meant keeping on good terms with the Saarkkadic government . The Saarkkada themselves were humanoid in physical form — if one allowed the term to cover a wide range of differences — but their minds just did n't function along the same lines . For nine years , Bertrand Malloy had been Ambassador to Saarkkad , and for nine years , no Saarkkada had ever seen him . To have shown himself to one of them would have meant instant loss of prestige . To their way of thinking , an important official was aloof . The greater his importance , the greater must be his isolation . The Occeq of Saarkkad himself was never seen except by a handful of picked nobles , who , themselves , were never seen except by their underlings . It was a long , roundabout way of doing business , but it was the only way Saarkkad would do any business at all . To violate the rigid social setup of Saarkkad would mean the instant closing off of the supply of biochemical products that the Saarkkadic laboratories produced from native plants and animals — products that were vitally necessary to Earth 's war , and which could be duplicated nowhere else in the known universe . It was Bertrand Malloy 's job to keep the production output high and to keep the materiel flowing towards Earth and her allies and outposts . The job would have been a snap cinch in the right circumstances ; the Saarkkada were n't difficult to get along with . A staff of top-grade men could have handled them without half trying . But Malloy did n't have top-grade men . They could n't be spared from work that required their total capacity . It 's inefficient to waste a man on a job that he can do without half trying where there are more important jobs that will tax his full output . So Malloy was stuck with the culls . Not the worst ones , of course ; there were places in the galaxy that were less important than Saarkkad to the war effort . Malloy knew that , no matter what was wrong with a man , as long as he had the mental ability to dress himself and get himself to work , useful work could be found for him . Physical handicaps were n't at all difficult to deal with . A blind man can work very well in the total darkness of an infrared-film darkroom . Partial or total losses of limbs can be compensated for in one way or another . The mental disabilities were harder to deal with , but not totally impossible . On a world without liquor , a dipsomaniac could be channeled easily enough ; and he 'd better not try fermenting his own on Saarkkad unless he brought his own yeast — which was impossible , in view of the sterilization regulations . But Malloy did n't like to stop at merely thwarting mental quirks ; he liked to find places where they were useful . The phone chimed . Malloy flipped it on with a practiced hand . “ Malloy here. ” “ Mr. Malloy ? ” said a careful voice . “ A special communication for you has been teletyped in from Earth . Shall I bring it in ? ” “ Bring it in , Miss Drayson. ” Miss Drayson was a case in point . She was uncommunicative . She liked to gather in information , but she found it difficult to give it up once it was in her possession . Malloy had made her his private secretary . Nothing — but nothing — got out of Malloy 's office without his direct order . It had taken Malloy a long time to get it into Miss Drayson 's head that it was perfectly all right — even desirable — for her to keep secrets from everyone except Malloy . She came in through the door , a rather handsome woman in her middle thirties , clutching a sheaf of papers in her right hand as though someone might at any instant snatch it from her before she could turn it over to Malloy . She laid them carefully on the desk . “ If anything else comes in , I 'll let you know immediately , sir , ” she said . “ Will there be anything else ? ” Malloy let her stand there while he picked up the communique . She wanted to know what his reaction was going to be ; it did n't matter because no one would ever find out from her what he had done unless she was ordered to tell someone . He read the first paragraph , and his eyes widened involuntarily . “ Armistice , ” he said in a low whisper . “ There 's a chance that the war may be over. ” “ Yes , sir , ” said Miss Drayson in a hushed voice . Malloy read the whole thing through , fighting to keep his emotions in check . Miss Drayson stood there calmly , her face a mask ; her emotions were a secret . Finally , Malloy looked up . “ I 'll let you know as soon as I reach a decision , Miss Drayson . I think I hardly need say that no news of this is to leave this office. ” “ Of course not , sir. ” Malloy watched her go out the door without actually seeing her . The war was over — at least for a while . He looked down at the papers again . The Karna , slowly being beaten back on every front , were suing for peace . They wanted an armistice conference — immediately . Earth was willing . Interstellar war is too costly to allow it to continue any longer than necessary , and this one had been going on for more than thirteen years now . Peace was necessary . But not peace at any price . The trouble was that the Karna had a reputation for losing wars and winning at the peace table . They were clever , persuasive talkers . They could twist a disadvantage to an advantage , and make their own strengths look like weaknesses . If they won the armistice , they 'd be able to retrench and rearm , and the war would break out again within a few years . Now — at this point in time — they could be beaten . They could be forced to allow supervision of the production potential , forced to disarm , rendered impotent . But if the armistice went to their own advantage ... Already , they had taken the offensive in the matter of the peace talks . They had sent a full delegation to Saarkkad V , the next planet out from the Saarkkad sun , a chilly world inhabited only by low-intelligence animals . The Karna considered this to be fully neutral territory , and Earth could n't argue the point very well . In addition , they demanded that the conference begin in three days , Terrestrial time . The trouble was that interstellar communication beams travel a devil of a lot faster than ships . It would take more than a week for the Earth government to get a vessel to Saarkkad V. Earth had been caught unprepared for an armistice . They objected . The Karna pointed out that the Saarkkad sun was just as far from Karn as it was from Earth , that it was only a few million miles from a planet which was allied with Earth , and that it was unfair for Earth to take so much time in preparing for an armistice . Why had n't Earth been prepared ? Did they intend to fight to the utter destruction of Karn ? It would n't have been a problem at all if Earth and Karn had fostered the only two intelligent races in the galaxy . The sort of grandstanding the Karna were putting on had to be played to an audience . But there were other intelligent races throughout the galaxy , most of whom had remained as neutral as possible during the Earth-Karn war . They had no intention of sticking their figurative noses into a battle between the two most powerful races in the galaxy . But whoever won the armistice would find that some of the now-neutral races would come in on their side if war broke out again . If the Karna played their cards right , their side would be strong enough next time to win . So Earth had to get a delegation to meet with the Karna representatives within the three-day limit or lose what might be a vital point in the negotiations . And that was where Bertrand Malloy came in . He had been appointed Minister and Plenipotentiary Extraordinary to the Earth-Karn peace conference . He looked up at the ceiling again . “ What can I do ? ” he said softly . On the second day after the arrival of the communique , Malloy made his decision . He flipped on his intercom and said : “ Miss Drayson , get hold of James Nordon and Kylen Braynek . I want to see them both immediately . Send Nordon in first , and tell Braynek to wait. ” “ Yes , sir. ” “ And keep the recorder on . You can file the tape later. ” “ Yes , sir. ” Malloy knew the woman would listen in on the intercom anyway , and it was better to give her permission to do so . James Nordon was tall , broad-shouldered , and thirty-eight . His hair was graying at the temples , and his handsome face looked cool and efficient . Malloy waved him to a seat . “ Nordon , I have a job for you . It 's probably one of the most important jobs you 'll ever have in your life . It can mean big things for you — promotion and prestige if you do it well. ” Nordon nodded slowly . “ Yes , sir. ” Malloy explained the problem of the Karna peace talks . “ We need a man who can outthink them , ” Malloy finished , “ and judging from your record , I think you 're that man . It involves risk , of course . If you make the wrong decisions , your name will be mud back on Earth . But I do n't think there 's much chance of that , really . Do you want to handle small-time operations all your life ? Of course not . “ You 'll be leaving within an hour for Saarkkad V. ” Nordon nodded again . “ Yes , sir ; certainly . Am I to go alone ? ” “ No , ” said Malloy , “ I 'm sending an assistant with you — a man named Kylen Braynek . Ever heard of him ? ” Nordon shook his head . “ Not that I recall , Mr. Malloy . Should I have ? ” “ Not necessarily . He 's a pretty shrewd operator , though . He knows a lot about interstellar law , and he 's capable of spotting a trap a mile away . You 'll be in charge , of course , but I want you to pay special attention to his advice. ” “ I will , sir , ” Nordon said gratefully . “ A man like that can be useful. ” “ Right . Now , you go into the anteroom over there . I 've prepared a summary of the situation , and you 'll have to study it and get it into your head before the ship leaves . That is n't much time , but it 's the Karna who are doing the pushing , not us. ” As soon as Nordon had left , Malloy said softly : “ Send in Braynek , Miss Drayson. ” Kylen Braynek was a smallish man with mouse-brown hair that lay flat against his skull , and hard , penetrating , dark eyes that were shadowed by heavy , protruding brows . Malloy asked him to sit down . Again Malloy went through the explanation of the peace conference . “ Naturally , they 'll be trying to trick you every step of the way , ” Malloy went on . “ They 're shrewd and underhanded ; we 'll simply have to be more shrewd and more underhanded . Nordon 's job is to sit quietly and evaluate the data ; yours will be to find the loopholes they 're laying out for themselves and plug them . Do n't antagonize them , but do n't baby them , either . If you see anything underhanded going on , let Nordon know immediately. ” “ They wo n't get anything by me , Mr. Malloy. ” By the time the ship from Earth got there , the peace conference had been going on for four days . Bertrand Malloy had full reports on the whole parley , as relayed to him through the ship that had taken Nordon and Braynek to Saarkkad V . Secretary of State Blendwell stopped off at Saarkkad IV before going on to V to take charge of the conference . He was a tallish , lean man with a few strands of gray hair on the top of his otherwise bald scalp , and he wore a hearty , professional smile that did n't quite make it to his calculating eyes . He took Malloy 's hand and shook it warmly . “ How are you , Mr . Ambassador ? ” “ Fine , Mr. Secretary . How 's everything on Earth ? ” “ Tense . They 're waiting to see what is going to happen on Five . So am I , for that matter. ” His eyes were curious . “ You decided not to go yourself , eh ? ” “ I thought it better not to . I sent a good team , instead . Would you like to see the reports ? ” “ I certainly would. ” Malloy handed them to the secretary , and as he read , Malloy watched him . Blendwell was a political appointee — a good man , Malloy had to admit , but he did n't know all the ins and outs of the Diplomatic Corps . When Blendwell looked up from the reports at last , he said : “ Amazing ! They 've held off the Karna at every point ! They 've beaten them back ! They 've managed to cope with and outdo the finest team of negotiators the Karna could send. ” “ I thought they would , ” said Malloy , trying to appear modest . The secretary 's eyes narrowed . “ I 've heard of the work you 've been doing here with ... ah ... sick men . Is this one of your ... ah ... successes ? ” Malloy nodded . “ I think so . The Karna put us in a dilemma , so I threw a dilemma right back at them. ” “ How do you mean ? ” “ Nordon had a mental block against making decisions . If he took a girl out on a date , he 'd have trouble making up his mind whether to kiss her or not until she made up his mind for him , one way or the other . He 's that kind of guy . Until he 's presented with one , single , clear decision which admits of no alternatives , he can n't move at all . “ As you can see , the Karna tried to give us several choices on each point , and they were all rigged . Until they backed down to a single point and proved that it was n't rigged , Nordon could n't possibly make up his mind . I drummed into him how important this was , and the more importance there is attached to his decisions , the more incapable he becomes of making them. ” The Secretary nodded slowly . “ What about Braynek ? ” “ Paranoid , ” said Malloy . “ He thinks everyone is plotting against him . In this case , that 's all to the good because the Karna are plotting against him . No matter what they put forth , Braynek is convinced that there 's a trap in it somewhere , and he digs to find out what the trap is . Even if there is n't a trap , the Karna can n't satisfy Braynek , because he 's convinced that there has to be — somewhere . As a result , all his advice to Nordon , and all his questioning on the wildest possibilities , just serves to keep Nordon from getting unconfused . “ These two men are honestly doing their best to win at the peace conference , and they 've got the Karna reeling . The Karna can see that we 're not trying to stall ; our men are actually working at trying to reach a decision . But what the Karna do n't see is that those men , as a team , are unbeatable because , in this situation , they 're psychologically incapable of losing. ” Again the Secretary of State nodded his approval , but there was still a question in his mind . “ Since you know all that , could n't you have handled it yourself ? ” “ Maybe , but I doubt it . They might have gotten around me someway by sneaking up on a blind spot . Nordon and Braynek have blind spots , but they 're covered with armor . No , I 'm glad I could n't go ; it 's better this way. ” The Secretary of State raised an eyebrow . “ Could n't go , Mr . Ambassador ? ” Malloy looked at him . “ Did n't you know ? I wondered why you appointed me , in the first place . No , I could n't go . The reason why I 'm here , cooped up in this office , hiding from the Saarkkada the way a good Saarkkadic bigshot should , is because I like it that way . I suffer from agoraphobia and xenophobia . “ I have to be drugged to be put on a spaceship because I can n't take all that empty space , even if I 'm protected from it by a steel shell. ” A look of revulsion came over his face . “ And I can n't stand aliens ! ” THE END
