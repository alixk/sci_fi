FOREVER By NED LANG Of all the irksome , frustrating , maddening discoveries — was there no way of keeping it discovered ? Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS With so much at stake , Charles Dennison should not have been careless . An inventor cannot afford carelessness , particularly when his invention is extremely valuable and obviously patentable . There are too many grasping hands ready to seize what belongs to someone else , too many men who feast upon the creativity of the innocent . A touch of paranoia would have served Dennison well ; but he was lacking in that vital characteristic of inventors . And he did n't even realize the full extent of his carelessness until a bullet , fired from a silenced weapon , chipped a granite wall not three inches from his head . Then he knew . But by then it was too late . Charles Dennison had been left a more than adequate income by his father . He had gone to Harvard , served a hitch in the Navy , then continued his education at M. I. T . Since the age of thirty-two , he had been engaged in private research , working in his own small laboratory in Riverdale , New York . Plant biology was his field . He published several noteworthy papers , and sold a new insecticide to a development corporation . The royalties helped him to expand his facilities . Dennison enjoyed working alone . It suited his temperament , which was austere but not unfriendly . Two or three times a year , he would come to New York , see some plays and movies , and do a little serious drinking . He would then return gratefully to his seclusion . He was a bachelor and seemed destined to remain that way . Not long after his fortieth birthday , Dennison stumbled across an intriguing clue which led him into a different branch of biology . He pursued his clue , developed it , extended it slowly into a hypothesis . After three more years , a lucky accident put the final proofs into his hands . He had invented a most effective longevity drug . It was not proof against violence ; aside from that , however , it could fairly be called an immortality serum . Now was the time for caution . But years of seclusion had made Dennison unwary of people and their motives . He was more or less heedless of the world around him ; it never occurred to him that the world was not equally heedless of him . He thought only about his serum . It was valuable and patentable . But was it the sort of thing that should be revealed ? Was the world ready for an immortality drug ? He had never enjoyed speculation of this sort . But since the atom bomb , many scientists had been forced to look at the ethics of their profession . Dennison looked at his and decided that immortality was inevitable . Mankind had , throughout its existence , poked and probed into the recesses of nature , trying to figure out how things worked . If one man did n't discover fire , or the use of the lever , or gunpowder , or the atom bomb , or immortality , another would . Man willed to know all nature 's secrets , and there was no way of keeping them hidden . Armed with this bleak but comforting philosophy , Dennison packed his formulas and proofs into a briefcase , slipped a two-ounce bottle of the product into a jacket pocket , and left his Riverdale laboratory . It was already evening . He planned to spend the night in a good midtown hotel , see a movie , and proceed to the Patent Office in Washington the following day . On the subway , Dennison was absorbed in a newspaper . He was barely conscious of the men sitting on either side of him . He became aware of them only when the man on his right poked him firmly in the ribs . Dennison glanced over and saw the snub nose of a small automatic , concealed from the rest of the car by a newspaper , resting against his side . “ What is this ? ” Dennison asked . “ Hand it over , ” the man said . Dennison was stunned . How could anyone have known about his discovery ? And how could they dare try to rob him in a public subway car ? Then he realized that they were probably just after his money . “ I do n't have much on me , ” Dennison said hoarsely , reaching for his wallet . The man on his left leaned over and slapped the briefcase . “ Not money , ” he said . “ The immortality stuff. ” In some unaccountable fashion , they knew . What if he refused to give up his briefcase ? Would they dare fire the automatic in the subway ? It was a very small caliber weapon . Its noise might not even be heard above the subway 's roar . And probably they felt justified in taking the risk for a prize as great as the one Dennison carried . He looked at them quickly . They were mild-looking men , quietly , almost somberly dressed . Something about their clothing jogged Dennison 's memory unpleasantly , but he did n't have time to place the recollection . The automatic was digging painfully into his ribs . The subway was coming to a station . Dennison glanced at the man on his left and caught the glint of light on a tiny hypodermic . Many inventors , involved only in their own thoughts , are slow of reaction . But Dennison had been a gunnery officer in the Navy and had seen his share of action . He was damned if he was going to give up his invention so easily . He jumped from his seat and the hypo passed through the sleeve of his coat , just missing his arm . He swung the briefcase at the man with the automatic , catching him across the forehead with the metal edge . As the doors opened , he ran past a popeyed subway guard , up the stairs and into the street . The two men followed , one of them streaming blood from his forehead . Dennison ran , looking wildly around for a policeman . The men behind him were screaming , “ Stop , thief ! Police ! Police ! Stop that man ! ” Apparently they were also prepared to face the police and to claim the briefcase and bottle as their own . Ridiculous ! Yet the complete and indignant confidence in their shrill voices unnerved Dennison . He hated a scene . Still , a policeman would be best . The briefcase was filled with proof of who he was . Even his name was initialed on the outside of the briefcase . One glance would tell anyone ... He caught a flash of metal from his briefcase , and , still running , looked at it . He was shocked to see a metal plate fixed to the cowhide , over the place where his initials had been . The man on his left must have done that when he slapped the briefcase . Dennison dug at the plate with his fingertips , but it would not come off . It read , Property of Edward James Flaherty , Smithfield Institute . Perhaps a policeman would n't be so much help , after all . But the problem was academic , for Dennison saw no policeman along the crowded Bronx street . People stood aside as he ran past , staring open-mouthed , offering neither assistance nor interference . But the men behind him were still screaming , “ Stop the thief ! Stop the thief ! ” The entire long block was alerted . The people , like some sluggish beast goaded reluctantly into action , began to make tentative movements toward Dennison , impelled by the outraged cries of his pursuers . Unless he balanced the scales of public opinion , some do-gooder was going to interfere soon . Dennison conquered his shyness and pride , and called out , “ Help me ! They 're trying to rob me ! Stop them ! ” But his voice lacked the moral indignation , the absolute conviction of his two shrill-voiced pursuers . A burly young man stepped forward to block Dennison 's way , but at the last moment a woman pulled him back . “ Do n't get into trouble , Charley. ” “ Why do n't someone call a cop ? ” “ Yeah , where are the cops ? ” “ Over at a big fire on 178th Street , I hear. ” “ We oughta stop that guy. ” “ I 'm willing if you 're willing. ” Dennison 's way was suddenly blocked by four grinning youths , teen-agers in black motorcycle jackets and boots , excited by the chance for a little action , delighted at the opportunity to hit someone in the name of law and order . Illustration Dennison saw them , swerved suddenly and sprinted across the street . A bus loomed in front of him . He hurled himself out of its way , fell , got up again and ran on . His pursuers were delayed by the dense flow of traffic . Their high-pitched cries faded as Dennison turned into a side street , ran down its length , then down another . He was in a section of massive apartment buildings . His lungs felt like a blast furnace and his left side seemed to be sewed together with red-hot wire . There was no help for it , he had to rest . It was then that the first bullet , fired from a silenced weapon , chipped a granite wall not three inches from his head . That was when Dennison realized the full extent of his carelessness . He pulled the bottle out of his pocket . He had hoped to carry out more experiments on the serum before trying it on human beings . Now there was no choice . Dennison yanked out the stopper and drained the contents . Immediately he was running again , as a second bullet scored the granite wall . The great blocks of apartments loomed endlessly ahead of him , silent and alien . There were no walkers upon the streets . There was only Dennison , running more slowly now past the immense , blank-faced apartments . A long black car came up behind him , its searchlight probing into doors and alleys . Was it the police ? “ That 's him ! ” cried the shrill , unnerving voice of one of Dennison 's pursuers . Dennison ducked into a narrow alley between buildings , raced down it and into the next street . There were two cars on that street , at either end of the block , their headlights shining toward each other , moving slowly to trap him in the middle . The alley gleamed with light now , from the first car 's headlights shining down it . He was surrounded . Dennison raced to the nearest apartment building and yanked at the door . It was locked . The two cars were almost even with him . And , looking at them , Dennison remembered the unpleasant jog his memory had given him earlier . The two cars were hearses . The men in the subway , with their solemn faces , solemn clothing , subdued neckties , shrill , indignant voices — they had reminded him of undertakers . They had been undertakers ! Of course ! Of course ! Oil companies might want to block the invention of a cheap new fuel which could put them out of business ; steel corporations might try to stop the development of an inexpensive , stronger-than-steel plastic ... And the production of an immortality serum would put the undertakers out of business . His progress , and the progress of thousands of other researchers in biology , must have been watched . And when he made his discovery , they had been ready . The hearses stopped , and somber-faced , respectable-looking men in black suits and pearl-gray neckties poured out and seized him . The briefcase was yanked out of his hand . He felt the prick of a needle in his shoulder . Then , with no transitional dizziness , he passed out . He came to sitting in an armchair . There were armed men on either side of him . In front of him stood a small , plump , undistinguished-looking man in sedate clothing . “ My name is Mr. Bennet , ” the plump man said . “ I wish to beg your forgiveness , Mr. Dennison , for the violence to which you were subjected . We found out about your invention only at the last moment and therefore had to improvise . The bullets were meant only to frighten and delay you . Murder was not our intention. ” “ You merely wanted to steal my discovery , ” Dennison said . “ Not at all , ” Mr. Bennet told him . “ The secret of immortality has been in our possession for quite some time. ” “ I see . Then you want to keep immortality from the public in order to safeguard your damned undertaking business ! ” “ Is n't that rather a naive view ? ” Mr. Bennet asked , smiling . “ As it happens , my associates and I are not undertakers . We took on the disguise in order to present an understandable motive if our plan to capture you had misfired . In that event , others would have believed exactly — and only — what you thought : that our purpose was to safeguard our business. ” Dennison frowned and watchfully waited . “ Disguises come easily to us , ” Mr. Bennet said , still smiling . “ Perhaps you have heard rumors about a new carburetor suppressed by the gasoline companies , or a new food source concealed by the great food suppliers , or a new synthetic hastily destroyed by the cotton-owning interests . That was us . And the inventions ended up here. ” “ You 're trying to impress me , ” Dennison said . “ Certainly. ” “ Why did you stop me from patenting my immortality serum ? ” “ The world is not ready for it yet , ” said Mr. Bennet . “ It is n't ready for a lot of things , ” Dennison said . “ Why did n't you block the atom bomb ? ” “ We tried , disguised as mercenary coal and oil interests . But we failed . However , we have succeeded with a surprising number of things. ” “ But what 's the purpose behind it all ? ” “ Earth 's welfare , ” Mr. Bennet said promptly . “ Consider what would happen if the people were given your veritable immortality serum . The problems of birth rate , food production , living space all would be aggravated . Tensions would mount , war would be imminent — ” “ So what ? ” Dennison challenged . “ That 's how things are right now , without immortality . Besides , there have been cries of doom about every new invention or discovery . Gunpowder , the printing press , nitroglycerin , the atom bomb , they were all supposed to destroy the race . But mankind has learned how to handle them . It had to ! You can n't turn back the clock , and you can n't un-discover something . If it 's there , mankind must deal with it ! ” “ Yes , in a bumbling , bloody , inefficient fashion , ” said Mr. Bennet , with an expression of distaste . “ Well , that 's how Man is. ” “ Not if he 's properly led , ” Mr. Bennet said . “ No ? ” “ Certainly not , ” said Mr. Bennet . “ You see , the immortality serum provides a solution to the problem of political power . Rule by a permanent and enlightened elite is by far the best form of government ; infinitely better than the blundering inefficiencies of democratic rule . But throughout history , this elite , whether monarchy , oligarchy , dictatorship or junta , has been unable to perpetuate itself . Leaders die , the followers squabble for power , and chaos is close behind . With immortality , this last flaw would be corrected . There would be no discontinuity of leadership , for the leaders would always be there. ” “ A permanent dictatorship , ” Dennison said . “ Yes . A permanent , benevolent rule by small , carefully chosen elite corps , based upon the sole and exclusive possession of immortality . It 's historically inevitable . The only question is , who is going to get control first ? ” “ And you think you are ? ” Dennison demanded . “ Of course . Our organization is still small , but absolutely solid . It is bolstered by every new invention that comes into our hands and by every scientist who joins our ranks . Our time will come , Dennison ! We 'd like to have you with us , among the elite. ” “ You want me to join you ? ” Dennison asked , bewildered . “ We do . Our organization needs creative scientific minds to help us in our work , to help us save mankind from itself. ” “ Count me out , ” Dennison said , his heart beating fast . “ You wo n't join us ? ” “ I 'd like to see you all hanged. ” Mr. Bennet nodded thoughtfully and pursed his small lips . “ You have taken your own serum , have you not ? ” Dennison nodded . “ I suppose that means you kill me now ? ” “ We do n't kill , ” Mr. Bennet said . “ We merely wait . I think you are a reasonable man , and I think you 'll come to see things our way . We 'll be around a long time . So will you . Take him away. ” Dennison was led to an elevator that dropped deep into the Earth . He was marched down a long passageway lined with armed men . They went through four massive doors . At the fifth , Dennison was pushed inside alone , and the door was locked behind him . He was in a large , well-furnished apartment . There were perhaps twenty people in the room , and they came forward to meet him . One of them , a stocky , bearded man , was an old college acquaintance of Dennison 's . “ Jim Ferris ? ” “ That 's right , ” Ferris said . “ Welcome to the Immortality Club , Dennison. ” “ I read you were killed in an air crash last year. ” “ I merely — disappeared , ” Ferris said , with a rueful smile , “ after inventing the immortality serum . Just like the others. ” “ All of them ? ” “ Fifteen of the men here invented the serum independently . The rest are successful inventors in other fields . Our oldest member is Doctor Li , a serum discoverer , who disappeared from San Francisco in 1911 . You are our latest acquisition . Our clubhouse is probably the most carefully guarded place on Earth. ” Dennison said , “ Nineteen-eleven ! ” Despair flooded him and he sat down heavily in a chair . “ Then there 's no possibility of rescue ? ” “ None . There are only four choices available to us , ” Ferris said . “ Some have left us and joined the Undertakers . Others have suicided . A few have gone insane . The rest of us have formed the Immortality Club. ” “ What for ? ” Dennison bewilderedly asked . “ To get out of this place ! ” said Ferris . “ To escape and give our discoveries to the world . To stop those hopeful little dictators upstairs. ” “ They must know what you 're planning. ” “ Of course . But they let us live because , every so often , one of us gives up and joins them . And they do n't think we can ever break out . They 're much too smug . It 's the basic defect of all power-elites , and their eventual undoing. ” “ You said this was the most closely guarded place on Earth ? ” “ It is , ” Ferris said . “ And some of you have been trying to break out for fifty years ? Why , it 'll take forever to escape ! ” “ Forever is exactly how long we have , ” said Ferris . “ But we hope it wo n't take quite that long . Every new man brings new ideas , plans . One of them is bound to work. ” “ Forever , ” Dennison said , his face buried in his hands . “ You can go back upstairs and join them , ” Ferris said , with a hard note to his voice , “ or you can suicide , or just sit in a corner and go quietly mad . Take your pick. ” Dennison looked up . “ I must be honest with you and with myself . I do n't think we can escape . Furthermore , I do n't think any of you really believe we can. ” Ferris shrugged his shoulders . “ Aside from that , ” Dennison said , “ I think it 's a damned good idea . If you 'll bring me up to date , I 'll contribute whatever I can to the Forever Project . And let 's hope their complacency lasts. ” “ It will , ” Ferris said . The escape did not take forever , of course . In one hundred and thirty-seven years , Dennison and his colleagues made their successful breakout and revealed the Undertakers ’ Plot . The Undertakers were tried before the High Court on charges of kidnapping , conspiracy to overthrow the government , and illegal possession of immortality . They were found guilty on all counts and summarily executed . Dennison and his colleagues were also in illegal possession of immortality , which is the privilege only of our governmental elite . But the death penalty was waived in view of the Immortality Club 's service to the State . This mercy was premature , however . After some months the members of the Immortality Club went into hiding , with the avowed purpose of overthrowing the Elite Rule and disseminating immortality among the masses . Project Forever , as they termed it , has received some support from dissidents , who have not yet been apprehended . It cannot be considered a serious threat . But this deviationist action in no way detracts from the glory of the Club 's escape from the Undertakers . The ingenious way in which Dennison and his colleagues broke out of their seemingly impregnable prison , using only a steel belt buckle , a tungsten filament , three hens ’ eggs , and twelve chemicals that can be readily obtained from the human body , is too well known to be repeated here . — NED LANG
