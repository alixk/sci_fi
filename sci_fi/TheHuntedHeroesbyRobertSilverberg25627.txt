THE HUNTED HEROES By ROBERT SILVERBERG The planet itself was tough enough — barren , desolate , forbidding ; enough to stop the most adventurous and dedicated . But they had to run head-on against a mad genius who had a motto : Death to all Terrans ! “ Let 's keep moving , ” I told Val . “ The surest way to die out here on Mars is to give up. ” I reached over and turned up the pressure on her oxymask to make things a little easier for her . Through the glassite of the mask , I could see her face contorted in an agony of fatigue . And she probably thought the failure of the sandcat was all my fault , too . Val 's usually about the best wife a guy could ask for , but when she wants to be she can be a real flying bother . It was beyond her to see that some grease monkey back at the Dome was at fault — whoever it was who had failed to fasten down the engine hood . Nothing but what had stopped us could stop a sandcat : sand in the delicate mechanism of the atomic engine . But no ; she blamed it all on me somehow : So we were out walking on the spongy sand of the Martian desert . We 'd been walking a good eight hours . “ Ca n't we turn back now , Ron ? ” Val pleaded . “ Maybe there is n't any uranium in this sector at all . I think we 're crazy to keep on searching out here ! ” I started to tell her that the UranCo chief had assured me we 'd hit something out this way , but changed my mind . When Val 's tired and overwrought there 's no sense in arguing with her . I stared ahead at the bleak , desolate wastes of the Martian landscape . Behind us somewhere was the comfort of the Dome , ahead nothing but the mazes and gullies of this dead world . He was a cripple in a wheelchair — helpless as a rattlesnake . “ Try to keep going , Val. ” My gloved hand reached out and clumsily enfolded hers . “ Come on , kid . Remember — we 're doing this for Earth . We 're heroes. ” She glared at me . “ Heroes , hell ! ” she muttered . “ That 's the way it looked back home , but , out there it does n't seem so glorious . And UranCo 's pay is stinking. ” “ We did n't come out here for the pay , Val. ” “ I know , I know , but just the same — ” It must have been hell for her . We had wandered fruitlessly over the red sands all day , both of us listening for the clicks of the counter . And the geigers had been obstinately hushed all day , except for their constant undercurrent of meaningless noises . Even though the Martian gravity was only a fraction of Earth 's , I was starting to tire , and I knew it must have been really rough on Val with her lovely but unrugged legs . “ Heroes , ” she said bitterly . “ We 're not heroes — we 're suckers ! Why did I ever let you volunteer for the Geig Corps and drag me along ? ” Which was n't anywhere close to the truth . Now I knew she was at the breaking point , because Val did n't lie unless she was so exhausted she did n't know what she was doing . She had been just as much inflamed by the idea of coming to Mars to help in the search for uranium as I was . We knew the pay was poor , but we had felt it a sort of obligation , something we could do as individuals to keep the industries of radioactives-starved Earth going . And we 'd always had a roving foot , both of us . No , we had decided together to come to Mars — the way we decided together on everything . Now she was turning against me . I tried to jolly her . “ Buck up , kid , ” I said . I did n't dare turn up her oxy pressure any higher , but it was obvious she could n't keep going . She was almost sleep-walking now . We pressed on over the barren terrain . The geiger kept up a fairly steady click-pattern , but never broke into that sudden explosive tumult that meant we had found pay-dirt . I started to feel tired myself , terribly tired . I longed to lie down on the soft , spongy Martian sand and bury myself . I looked at Val . She was dragging along with her eyes half-shut . I felt almost guilty for having dragged her out to Mars , until I recalled that I had n't . In fact , she had come up with the idea before I did . I wished there was some way of turning the weary , bedraggled girl at my side back into the Val who had so enthusiastically suggested we join the Geigs . Twelve steps later , I decided this was about as far as we could go . I stopped , slipped out of the geiger harness , and lowered myself ponderously to the ground . “ What ' samatter , Ron ? ” Val asked sleepily . “ Something wrong ? ” “ No , baby , ” I said , putting out a hand and taking hers . “ I think we ought to rest a little before we go any further . It 's been a long , hard day. ” It did n't take much to persuade her . She slid down beside me , curled up , and in a moment she was fast asleep , sprawled out on the sands . Poor kid , I thought . Maybe we should n't have come to Mars after all . But , I reminded myself , someone had to do the job . A second thought appeared , but I squelched it : Why the hell me ? I looked down at Valerie 's sleeping form , and thought of our warm , comfortable little home on Earth . It was n't much , but people in love do n't need very fancy surroundings . I watched her , sleeping peacefully , a wayward lock of her soft blonde hair trailing down over one eyebrow , and it seemed hard to believe that we 'd exchanged Earth and all it held for us for the raw , untamed struggle that was Mars . But I knew I 'd do it again , if I had the chance . It 's because we wanted to keep what we had . Heroes ? Hell , no . We just liked our comforts , and wanted to keep them . Which took a little work . Time to get moving . But then Val stirred and rolled over in her sleep , and I did n't have the heart to wake her . I sat there , holding her , staring out over the desert , watching the wind whip the sand up into weird shapes . The Geig Corps preferred married couples , working in teams . That 's what had finally decided it for us — we were a good team . We had no ties on Earth that could n't be broken without much difficulty . So we volunteered . And here we are . Heroes . The wind blasted a mass of sand into my face , and I felt it tinkle against the oxymask . I glanced at the suit-chronometer . Getting late . I decided once again to wake Val . But she was tired . And I was tired too , tired from our wearying journey across the empty desert . I started to shake Val . But I never finished . It would be so nice just to lean back and nuzzle up to her , down in the sand . So nice . I yawned , and stretched back . I awoke with a sudden startled shiver , and realized angrily I had let myself doze off . “ Come on , Val , ” I said savagely , and started to rise to my feet . I could n't . I looked down . I was neatly bound in thin , tough , plastic tangle-cord , swathed from chin to boot-bottoms , my arms imprisoned , my feet caught . And tangle-cord is about as easy to get out of as a spider 's web is for a trapped fly . It was n't Martians that had done it . There were n't any Martians , had n't been for a million years . It was some Earthman who had bound us . I rolled my eyes toward Val , and saw that she was similarly trussed in the sticky stuff . The tangle-cord was still fresh , giving off a faint , repugnant odor like that of drying fish . It had been spun on us only a short time ago , I realized . “ Ron — ” “ Do n't try to move , baby . This stuff can break your neck if you twist it wrong. ” She continued for a moment to struggle futilely , and I had to snap , “ Lie still , Val ! ” “ A very wise statement , ” said a brittle , harsh voice from above me . I looked up and saw a helmeted figure above us . He was n't wearing the customary skin-tight pliable oxysuits we had . He wore an outmoded , bulky spacesuit and a fishbowl helmet , all but the face area opaque . The oxygen cannisters were n't attached to his back as expected , though . They were strapped to the back of the wheelchair in which he sat . Through the fishbowl I could see hard little eyes , a yellowed , parchment-like face , a grim-set jaw . I did n't recognize him , and this struck me odd . I thought I knew everyone on sparsely-settled Mars . Somehow I 'd missed him . What shocked me most was that he had no legs . The spacesuit ended neatly at the thighs . He was holding in his left hand the tanglegun with which he had entrapped us , and a very efficient-looking blaster was in his right . “ I did n't want to disturb your sleep , ” he said coldly . “ So I 've been waiting here for you to wake up. ” I could just see it . He might have been sitting there for hours , complacently waiting to see how we 'd wake up . That was when I realized he must be totally insane . I could feel my stomach-muscles tighten , my throat constrict painfully . Then anger ripped through me , washing away the terror . “ What 's going on ? ” I demanded , staring at the half of a man who confronted us from the wheelchair . “ Who are you ? ” “ You 'll find out soon enough , ” he said . “ Suppose now you come with me. ” He reached for the tanglegun , flipped the little switch on its side to MELT , and shot a stream of watery fluid over our legs , keeping the blaster trained on us all the while . Our legs were free . “ You may get up now , ” he said . “ Slowly , without trying to make trouble. ” Val and I helped each other to our feet as best we could , considering our arms were still tightly bound against the sides of our oxysuits . “ Walk , ” the stranger said , waving the tanglegun to indicate the direction . “ I 'll be right behind you. ” He holstered the tanglegun . I glimpsed the bulk of an outboard atomic rigging behind him , strapped to the back of the wheelchair . He fingered a knob on the arm of the chair and the two exhaust ducts behind the wheel-housings flamed for a moment , and the chair began to roll . Obediently , we started walking . You do n't argue with a blaster , even if the man pointing it is in a wheelchair . “ What 's going on , Ron ? ” Val asked in a low voice as we walked . Behind us the wheelchair hissed steadily . “ I do n't quite know , Val . I 've never seen this guy before , and I thought I knew everyone at the Dome. ” “ Quiet up there ! ” our captor called , and we stopped talking . We trudged along together , with him following behind ; I could hear the crunch-crunch of the wheelchair as its wheels chewed into the sand . I wondered where we were going , and why . I wondered why we had ever left Earth . The answer to that came to me quick enough : we had to . Earth needed radioactives , and the only way to get them was to get out and look . The great atomic wars of the late 20th Century had used up much of the supply , but the amount used to blow up half the great cities of the world hardly compared with the amount we needed to put them back together again . In three centuries the shattered world had been completely rebuilt . The wreckage of New York and Shanghai and London and all the other ruined cities had been hidden by a shining new world of gleaming towers and flying roadways . We had profited by our grandparents ’ mistakes . They had used their atomics to make bombs . We used ours for fuel . It was an atomic world . Everything : power drills , printing presses , typewriters , can openers , ocean liners , powered by the inexhaustible energy of the dividing atom . But though the energy is inexhaustible , the supply of nuclei is n't . After three centuries of heavy consumption , the supply failed . The mighty machine that was Earth 's industry had started to slow down . And that started the chain of events that led Val and me to end up as a madman 's prisoners , on Mars . With every source of uranium mined dry on Earth , we had tried other possibilities . All sorts of schemes came forth . Project Sea-Dredge was trying to get uranium from the oceans . In forty or fifty years , they 'd get some results , we hoped . But there was n't forty or fifty years ’ worth of raw stuff to tide us over until then . In a decade or so , our power would be just about gone . I could picture the sort of dog-eat-dog world we 'd revert back to . Millions of starving , freezing humans tooth-and-clawing in it in the useless shell of a great atomic civilization . So , Mars . There 's not much uranium on Mars , and it 's not easy to find or any cinch to mine . But what little is there , helps . It 's a stopgap effort , just to keep things moving until Project Sea-Dredge starts functioning . Enter the Geig Corps : volunteers out on the face of Mars , combing for its uranium deposits . And here we are , I thought . After we walked on a while , a Dome became visible up ahead . It slid up over the crest of a hill , set back between two hummocks on the desert . Just out of the way enough to escape observation . For a puzzled moment I thought it was our Dome , the settlement where all of UranCo 's Geig Corps were located , but another look told me that this was actually quite near us and fairly small . A one-man Dome , of all things ! “ Welcome to my home , ” he said . “ The name is Gregory Ledman. ” He herded us off to one side of the airlock , uttered a few words keyed to his voice , and motioned us inside when the door slid up . When we were inside he reached up , clumsily holding the blaster , and unscrewed the ancient spacesuit fishbowl . His face was a bitter , dried-up mask . He was a man who hated . The place was spartanly furnished . No chairs , no tape-player , no decoration of any sort . Hard bulkhead walls , rivet-studded , glared back at us . He had an automatic chef , a bed , and a writing-desk , and no other furniture . Suddenly he drew the tanglegun and sprayed our legs again . We toppled heavily to the floor . I looked up angrily . “ I imagine you want to know the whole story , ” he said . “ The others did , too. ” Valerie looked at me anxiously . Her pretty face was a dead white behind her oxymask . “ What others ? ” “ I never bothered to find out their names , ” Ledman said casually . “ They were other Geigs I caught unawares , like you , out on the desert . That 's the only sport I have left — Geig-hunting . Look out there. ” He gestured through the translucent skin of the Dome , and I felt sick . There was a little heap of bones lying there , looking oddly bright against the redness of the sands . They were the dried , parched skeletons of Earthmen . Bits of cloth and plastic , once oxymasks and suits , still clung to them . Suddenly I remembered . There had been a pattern there all the time . We did n't much talk about it ; we chalked it off as occupational hazards . There had been a pattern of disappearances on the desert . I could think of six , eight names now . None of them had been particularly close friends . You do n't get time to make close friends out here . But we 'd vowed it would n't happen to us . It had . “ You 've been hunting Geigs ? ” I asked . “ Why ? What 've they ever done to you ? ” He smiled , as calmly as if I 'd just praised his house-keeping . “ Because I hate you , ” he said blandly . “ I intend to wipe every last one of you out , one by one. ” I stared at him . I 'd never seen a man like this before ; I thought all his kind had died at the time of the atomic wars . I heard Val sob , “ He 's a madman ! ” “ No , ” Ledman said evenly . “ I 'm quite sane , believe me . But I 'm determined to drive the Geigs — and UranCo — off Mars . Eventually I 'll scare you all away. ” “ Just pick us off in the desert ? ” “ Exactly , ” replied Ledman . “ And I have no fears of an armed attack . This place is well fortified . I 've devoted years to building it . And I 'm back against those hills . They could n't pry me out. ” He let his pale hand run up into his gnarled hair . “ I 've devoted years to this . Ever since — ever since I landed here on Mars. ” “ What are you going to do with us ? ” Val finally asked , after a long silence . He did n't smile this time . “ Kill you , ” he told her . “ Not your husband . I want him as an envoy , to go back and tell the others to clear off. ” He rocked back and forth in his wheelchair , toying with the gleaming , deadly blaster in his hand . We stared in horror . It was a nightmare — sitting there , placidly rocking back and forth , a nightmare . I found myself fervently wishing I was back out there on the infinitely safer desert . “ Do I shock you ? ” he asked . “ I should n't — not when you see my motives. ” “ We do n't see them , ” I snapped . “ Well , let me show you . You 're on Mars hunting uranium , right ? To mine and ship the radioactives back to Earth to keep the atomic engines going . Right ? ” I nodded over at our geiger counters . “ We volunteered to come to Mars , ” Val said irrelevantly . “ Ah — two young heroes , ” Ledman said acidly . “ How sad . I could almost feel sorry for you . Almost. ” “ Just what is it you 're after ? ” I said , stalling , stalling . “ Atomics cost me my legs , ” he said . “ You remember the Sadlerville Blast ? ” he asked . “ Of course. ” And I did , too . I 'd never forget it . No one would . How could I forget that great accident — killing hundreds , injuring thousands more , sterilizing forty miles of Mississippi land — when the Sadlerville pile went up ? “ I was there on business at the time , ” Ledman said . “ I represented Ledman Atomics . I was there to sign a new contract for my company . You know who I am , now ? ” I nodded . “ I was fairly well shielded when it happened . I never got the contract , but I got a good dose of radiation instead . Not enough to kill me , ” he said . “ Just enough to necessitate the removal of — ” he indicated the empty space at his thighs . “ So I got off lightly. ” He gestured at the wheelchair blanket . I still did n't understand . “ But why kill us Geigs ? We had nothing to do with it. ” “ You 're just in this by accident , ” he said . “ You see , after the explosion and the amputation , my fellow-members on the board of Ledman Atomics decided that a semi-basket case like myself was a poor risk as Head of the Board , and they took my company away . All quite legal , I assure you . They left me almost a pauper ! ” Then he snapped the punchline at me . “ They renamed Ledman Atomics . Who did you say you worked for ? ” I began , “ Uran — ” “ Do n't bother . A more inventive title than Ledman Atomics , but not quite as much heart , would n't you say ? ” He grinned . “ I saved for years ; then I came to Mars , lost myself , built this Dome , and swore to get even . There 's not a great deal of uranium on this planet , but enough to keep me in a style to which , unfortunately , I 'm no longer accustomed. ” He consulted his wrist watch . “ Time for my injection. ” He pulled out the tanglegun and sprayed us again , just to make doubly certain . “ That 's another little souvenir of Sadlerville . I 'm short on red blood corpuscles. ” He rolled over to a wall table and fumbled in a container among a pile of hypodermics . “ There are other injections , too . Adrenalin , insulin . Others . The Blast turned me into a walking pin-cushion . But I 'll pay it all back , ” he said . He plunged the needle into his arm . My eyes widened . It was too nightmarish to be real . I was n't seriously worried about his threat to wipe out the entire Geig Corps , since it was unlikely that one man in a wheelchair could pick us all off . No , it was n't the threat that disturbed me , so much as the whole concept , so strange to me , that the human mind could be as warped and twisted as Ledman 's . I saw the horror on Val 's face , and I knew she felt the same way I did . “ Do you really think you can succeed ? ” I taunted him . “ Really think you can kill every Earthman on Mars ? Of all the insane , cockeyed — ” Val 's quick , worried head-shake cut me off . But Ledman had felt my words , all right . “ Yes ! I 'll get even with every one of you for taking away my legs ! If we had n't meddled with the atom in the first place , I 'd be as tall and powerful as you , today — instead of a useless cripple in a wheelchair. ” “ You 're sick , Gregory Ledman , ” Val said quietly . “ You 've conceived an impossible scheme of revenge and now you 're taking it out on innocent people who 've done nothing , nothing at all to you . That 's not sane ! ” His eyes blazed . “ Who are you to talk of sanity ? ” Uneasily I caught Val 's glance from a corner of my eye . Sweat was rolling down her smooth forehead faster than the auto-wiper could swab it away . “ Why do n't you do something ? What are you waiting for , Ron ? ” “ Easy , baby , ” I said . I knew what our ace in the hole was . But I had to get Ledman within reach of me first . “ Enough , ” he said . “ I 'm going to turn you loose outside , right after — ” “ Get sick ! ” I hissed to Val , low . She began immediately to cough violently , emitting harsh , choking sobs . “ Ca n't breathe ! ” She began to yell , writhing in her bonds . That did it . Ledman had n't much humanity left in him , but there was a little . He lowered the blaster a bit and wheeled one-hand over to see what was wrong with Val . She continued to retch and moan most horribly . It almost convinced me . I saw Val 's pale , frightened face turn to me . He approached and peered down at her . He opened his mouth to say something , and at that moment I snapped my leg up hard , tearing the tangle-cord with a snicking rasp , and kicked his wheelchair over . The blaster went off , burning a hole through the Dome roof . The automatic sealers glued-in instantly . Ledman went sprawling helplessly out into the middle of the floor , the wheelchair upended next to him , its wheels slowly revolving in the air . The blaster flew from his hands at the impact of landing and spun out near me . In one quick motion I rolled over and covered it with my body . Ledman clawed his way to me with tremendous effort and tried wildly to pry the blaster out from under me , but without success . I twisted a bit , reached out with my free leg , and booted him across the floor . He fetched up against the wall of the Dome and lay there . Val rolled over to me . “ Now if I could get free of this stuff , ” I said , “ I could get him covered before he comes to . But how ? ” “ Teamwork , ” Val said . She swivelled around on the floor until her head was near my boot . “ Push my oxymask off with your foot , if you can. ” I searched for the clamp and tried to flip it . No luck , with my heavy , clumsy boot . I tried again , and this time it snapped open . I got the tip of my boot in and pried upward . The oxymask came off , slowly , scraping a jagged red scratch up the side of Val 's neck as it came . “ There , ” she breathed . “ That 's that. ” I looked uneasily at Ledman . He was groaning and beginning to stir . Val rolled on the floor and her face lay near my right arm . I saw what she had in mind . She began to nibble the vile-tasting tangle-cord , running her teeth up and down it until it started to give . She continued unfailingly . Finally one strand snapped . Then another . At last I had enough use of my hand to reach out and grasp the blaster . Then I pulled myself across the floor to Ledman , removed the tanglegun , and melted the remaining tangle-cord off . My muscles were stiff and bunched , and rising made me wince . I turned and freed Val . Then I turned and faced Ledman . “ I suppose you 'll kill me now , ” he said . “ No . That 's the difference between sane people and insane , ” I told him . “ I 'm not going to kill you at all . I 'm going to see to it that you 're sent back to Earth. ” “ No ! ” he shouted . “ No ! Anything but back there . I do n't want to face them again — not after what they did to me — ” “ Not so loud , ” I broke in . “ They 'll help you on Earth . They 'll take all the hatred and sickness out of you , and turn you into a useful member of society again. ” “ I hate Earthmen , ” he spat out . “ I hate all of them. ” “ I know , ” I said sarcastically . “ You 're just all full of hate . You hated us so much that you could n't bear to hang around on Earth for as much as a year after the Sadlerville Blast . You had to take right off for Mars without a moment 's delay , did n't you ? You hated Earth so much you had to leave. ” “ Why are you telling all this to me ? ” “ Because if you 'd stayed long enough , you 'd have used some of your pension money to buy yourself a pair of prosthetic legs , and then you would n't need this wheelchair. ” Ledman scowled , and then his face went belligerent again . “ They told me I was paralyzed below the waist . That I 'd never walk again , even with prosthetic legs , because I had no muscles to fit them to. ” “ You left Earth too quickly , ” Val said . “ It was the only way , ” he protested . “ I had to get off — ” “ She 's right , ” I told him . “ The atom can take away , but it can give as well . Soon after you left they developed atomic-powered prosthetics — amazing things , virtually robot legs . All the survivors of the Sadlerville Blast were given the necessary replacement limbs free of charge . All except you . You were so sick you had to get away from the world you despised and come here. ” “ You 're lying , ” he said . “ It 's not true ! ” “ Oh , but it is , ” Val smiled . I saw him wilt visibly , and for a moment I almost felt sorry for him , a pathetic legless figure propped up against the wall of the Dome at blaster-point . But then I remembered he 'd killed twelve Geigs — or more — and would have added Val to the number had he had the chance . “ You 're a very sick man , Ledman , ” I said . “ All this time you could have been happy , useful on Earth , instead of being holed up here nursing your hatred . You might have been useful , on Earth . But you decided to channel everything out as revenge. ” “ I still do n't believe it — those legs . I might have walked again . No — no , it 's all a lie . They told me I 'd never walk , ” he said , weakly but stubbornly still . I could see his whole structure of hate starting to topple , and I decided to give it the final push . “ Have n't you wondered how I managed to break the tangle-cord when I kicked you over ? ” “ Yes — human legs are n't strong enough to break tangle-cord that way. ” “ Of course not , ” I said . I gave Val the blaster and slipped out of my oxysuit . “ Look , ” I said . I pointed to my smooth , gleaming metal legs . The almost soundless purr of their motors was the only noise in the room . “ I was in the Sadlerville Blast , too , ” I said . “ But I did n't go crazy with hate when I lost my legs. ” Ledman was sobbing . “ Okay , Ledman , ” I said . Val got him into his suit , and brought him the fishbowl helmet . “ Get your helmet on and let 's go . Between the psychs and the prosthetics men , you 'll be a new man inside of a year. ” “ But I 'm a murderer ! ” “ That 's right . And you 'll be sentenced to psych adjustment . When they 're finished , Gregory Ledman the killer will be as dead as if they 'd electrocuted you , but there 'll be a new — and sane — Gregory Ledman. ” I turned to Val . “ Got the geigers , honey ? ” For the first time since Ledman had caught us , I remembered how tired Val had been out on the desert . I realized now that I had been driving her mercilessly — me , with my chromium legs and atomic-powered muscles . No wonder she was ready to fold ! And I 'd been too dense to see how unfair I had been . She lifted the geiger harnesses , and I put Ledman back in his wheelchair . Val slipped her oxymask back on and fastened it shut . “ Let 's get back to the Dome in a hurry , ” I said . “ We 'll turn Ledman over to the authorities . Then we can catch the next ship for Earth. ” “ Go back ? Go back ? If you think I 'm backing down now and quitting you can find yourself another wife ! After we dump this guy I 'm sacking in for twenty hours , and then we 're going back out there to finish that search-pattern . Earth needs uranium , honey , and I know you 'd never be happy quitting in the middle like that. ” She smiled . “ I can n't wait to get out there and start listening for those tell-tale clicks. ” I gave a joyful whoop and swung her around . When I put her down , she squeezed my hand , hard . “ Let 's get moving , fellow hero , ” she said . I pressed the stud for the airlock , smiling . THE END
