The Undersea Tube BY L. TAYLOR HANSEN Classic Reprint from AMAZING STORIES , Nov ., 1929 Copyright , 1929 , by E. P. Incorporated Illustration If my friend the engineer had not told me the Tube was dangerous , I would not have bought a ticket on that fatal night , and the world would never have learned the story of the Golden Cavern and the City of the Dead . Having therefore , according to universal custom , first made my report as the sole survivor of the much-discussed Undersea Tube disaster to the International Committee for the Investigation of Disasters , I am now ready to outline that story for the world . Naturally I am aware of the many wild tales and rumors that have been circulated ever since the accident , but I must ask my readers to bear with me while I attempt to briefly sketch , not only the tremendous difficulties to be overcome by the engineers , but also the wind-propulsion theory which was made use of in this undertaking ; because it is only by understanding something of these two phases of the Tube 's engineering problems that one can understand the accident and its subsequent revelations . It will be recalled by those who have not allowed their view of modern history to become too hazy , that the close of the twentieth century saw a dream of the engineering world at last realized — the completion of the long-heralded undersea railroad . It will also be recalled that the engineers in charge of this stupendous undertaking were greatly encouraged by the signal success of the first tube under the English Channel , joining England and France by rail . However , it was from the second tube across the Channel and the tube connecting Montreal to New York , as well as the one connecting New York and Chicago , that they obtained some of their then radical ideas concerning the use of wind power for propulsion . Therefore , before the Undersea Tube had been completed , the engineers in charge had decided to make use of the new method in the world 's longest tunnel , and upon that decision work was immediately commenced upon the blue-prints for the great air pumps that were to rise at the two ends — Liverpool and New York . However , I will touch upon the theory of wind-propulsion later and after the manner in which it was explained to me . It will be recalled that after great ceremonies , the Tube was begun simultaneously at the two terminating cities and proceeded through solid rock — low enough below the ocean floor to overcome the terrible pressure of the body of water over it , and yet close enough to the sea to overcome the intensity of subterranean heat . Needless to say , it was an extremely hazardous undertaking , despite the very careful surveys that had been made , for the little parties of workmen could never tell when they would strike a crack or an unexpected crevice that would let down upon them with a terrible rush , the waters of the Atlantic . But hazard is adventure , and as the two little groups of laborers dug toward each other , the eyes of the press followed them with more persistent interest than it has ever followed the daily toil of any man or group of men , either before or since . Once the world was startled by the “ extree-ee — ” announcing that the English group had broken into an extinct volcano , whose upper end had apparently been sealed ages before , for it contained not water but air — curiously close and choking perhaps , but at least it was not the watery deluge of death . And then came the great discovery . No one who lived through that time will forget the thrill that quickened the pulse of mankind when the American group digging through a seam of old lava under what scientists call the “ ancient ridge , ” broke into a sealed cavern which gleamed in the probing flashlights of the workers like the scintillating points of a thousand diamonds . But when they found the jeweled casket , through whose glass top they peered curiously down upon the white body of a beautiful woman , partly draped in the ripples of her heavy , red hair , the world gasped and wondered . As every school child knows , the casket was opened by curious scientists , who flocked into the tube from the length of the world , but at the first exposure to the air , the strange liquid that had protected the body vanished , leaving in the casket not the white figure , but only a crumbling mass of grey dust . But the questions that the finding of the cave had raised remained unanswered . Illustration Who was this woman ? How did she get into the sealed cavern ? If she had been the court favorite of that mythical kingdom , now sunk beneath the waves , and had been disposed of in court intrigue , why would her murderers have buried her in such a casket ? How had she been killed ? An unknown poison ? Perhaps she had been a favorite slave of the monarch . This view gained many converts among the archaeologists who argued that from all the evidence we have available , the race carrying the Iberian or Proto-Egyptian culture , long thought to have been the true refugees from sinking Atlantis , were a slight dark-haired race . Therefore this woman must have been a captive . Geologists , analyzing the lava , announced that it had hardened in air and not in water , while anthropologists classed the skull of the woman as essentially more modern than either the Neanderthal or Cro-Magnon types . But the engineers , secretly fuming at the delay , finally managed to fill up the cave and press on with their drills . Then following the arguments that still flourished in the press , came a tiny little news article and the first message to carry concern to the hearts of the engineers . The sea had begun to trickle in through one slight crack . Perhaps it was only because the crevice was located on the English side of the now famous “ ancient ridge ” that the article brought forth any notice at all . But for the engineers it meant the first warning of possibly ultimate disaster . They could not seal the crack , and pumps were brought into play . However , as a month wore on , the crack did not appear to widen to any material extent and the danger cry of a few pessimists was forgotten . Finally , it will be remembered , that sounders listening in the rocks heard the drillers of the other party , and then with wild enthusiasm the work was pushed on to completion . The long Tube had been dug . Now it only remained for the sides at the junction to be enlarged and encased with cast iron , while the work of setting up the great machines designed to drive the pellet trains through , was also pushed on to its ultimate end . Man had essayed the greatest feat of engineering ever undertaken in the history of the planet , and had won . A period of wild celebration greeted the first human beings to cross each direction below the sea . Did the volume of water increase that was carried daily out of the Tube and dumped from the two stations ? If it did , the incident was ignored by the press . Instead , the fact that some “ cranks ” persisted in calling man 's latest toy unsafe , only attracted more travel . The Undersea Tube functioned on regular schedule for three years , became the usual method of ocean transit . This was the state of matters , when on the fourth of March last , our textile company ordered me to France to straighten out some orders with the France house , the situation being such that they preferred to send a man . Why they did not use radio-vision I do not care to state , as this is my company 's business . Therefore , upon entering my apartment , I was in the midst of packing when the television phone called me . The jovial features of “ Dutch ” Higgins , my one-time college room-mate and now one of the much-maligned engineers of the Undersea Tube , smiled back at me from the disk . “ Where are you ? I thought we had a sort of dinner engagement at my apartment , Bob. ” “ By gollies I forgot , Dutch . I 'll be right over — before it gets cold. ” Then immediately I turned the knob to the Municipal Aerial-car yards , and ordered my motor , as I grabbed my hat and hurried to the roof . In due time , of course , I sprang the big surprise of the evening , adding : “ And , of course , I 'm going by the Tube , I feel sort of a half-partnership in it because you were one of the designers. ” A curious half-pained look crossed his face . We had finished our meal , and were smoking with pushed-back chairs . He finished filling his pipe , and scowled . “ Well ? Why do n't you say something ? Thought you 'd be — well , sort of pleased. ” He struck his automatic lighter and drew in a long puff of smoke before answering . “ Wish you 'd take another route , Bob. ” “ Take another route ? ” “ Yes . If you want it straight , the Tube is not safe. ” “ You are joking. ” But as I looked into his cold , thoughtful blue eyes , I knew he had never been more serious . “ I wish that you would go by the Trans-Atlantic Air Liners . They are just as fast. ” “ But you used to be so enthusiastic about the Tube , Dutch ! Why I remember when it was being drilled that you would call me up at all kinds of wild hours to tell me the latest bits of news. ” He nodded slowly . “ Yes , that was in the days before the crack. ” “ Yet you expected to take care of possible leaks , you know , ” I countered . “ But this crack opened after the tunnel had been dug past it , and lately it has opened more. ” “ Are the other engineers alarmed ? ” “ No . We are easily taking care of the extra water and again the opening seems to remain at a stationary width as it has for the past three years . But we cannot caulk it. ” “ Are you going to publish these views ? ” “ No . I made out a minority report . I can do no more. ” “ Dutch , you are becoming over-cautious . First sign of old age. ” “ Perhaps , ” with the old smile . “ But after all it is now more than three years since we have had a talk on the Tube . After it began to function as well as the Air-Express you sort of lost interest in it. ” “ And the world did too. ” “ Certainly — but the public ever was a fickle mistress . Who said that before me ? ” He laughed and blew out a long puff of smoke . “ Everyone , Bob. ” “ But as to the Tube , if I cross under the sea , I would want to be as well informed on the road as I was three years ago . Now in the meantime , you have dropped interest in the long tunnel while I have become more interested in textiles — with the result that I have forgotten all I ever did know — which compared to your grasp of the details , was little enough. ” But his face showed none of the old-time animation on the subject . What a different man , I mused to myself , from that enthusiastic engineering student that I used to come upon dreaming over his blue-prints . He was considered “ half-cracked ” in those days when he would enthuse over his undersea railroad , but his animated face was lit with inspiration . Now the light was gone . “ Well , Dutch , how about it ? Are n't you going to make me that brief little sketch of the length plan and cross-section of the Tube ? I remember your sketch of it in college , and it tends to confuse me with the real changes that were made necessary when the wind-propulsion method was adopted. ” “ All right , old timer . You remember that the Tube was widened at the sides in order that we could make two circular tubes side by side — one going each way. ” “ I had forgotten that they were circular. ” “ That is because of the pressure . A circle presents the best resistance , ” and picking an odd envelope from his pocket , he made the following sketch and passed it to me . — CROSS-SECTION OF TUBE — I nodded as I recognized the cross-section . “ Now the plan of the thing is like this , ” he added , putting aside his pipe and pulling a sheet of paper from the corner of his desk . Rapidly , with all his old accuracy , he sketched the main plan and leaned over as he handed it to me . — PLAN OF UNDER-SEA TUBE — “ You see , ” he explained , picking up his pipe again , “ both pumps work at one time — in fact , I should say all four , because this plan is duplicated on the English side . On both ends then , a train is gently pushed in by an electric locomotive . A car at a time goes through the gate so that there is a cushion of air between each car . The same thing happens at Liverpool . Now , when the due train comes out of the suction tube , it goes on out the gate , but the air behind it travels right on around and comes in behind the train that is leaving. ” “ But how are you assured that it will not stall somewhere ? ” “ It wo n't be likely to with pressure pumps going behind it and suction pumps pulling from in front . We can always put extra power on if necessary . Thus far the road has worked perfectly. ” “ How much power do you need to send it through , under normal conditions ? ” “ Our trains have been averaging about fifty tons , and for that weight we have found that a pound pressure is quite sufficient . Now , taking the tunnel 's length as four thousand miles ( of course it is not that long , but round figures are most convenient ) and the tube width eleven and one quarter feet each and working this out we have 3 , 020 , 000 cubic feet of free air per minute or 2 , 904 , 000 cubic feet of compressed air , which would use about 70 , 000 horse power on the air compressor. ” “ But is n't the speed rather dizzy ? ” “ Not any more dizzy , Bob , than those old fashioned money-carrying machines that the department stores used to use — that is in comparison to size . The average speed is about 360 feet a second . Of course , the train is allowed to slow down toward the end of its run , even before it hits the braking machinery beyond the gate. ” “ But how much pressure did you say would be put on the back of the diaphragm — I remember that each car has a flat disc on the back that fits fairly tightly to the tube ... ” “ The pressure on the back is less than seven tons . However , the disc does not fit tight . There are several leaks . For instance , the cars are as you know , run on the principle of the monorail with a guiding rail on each side . The grooves for the rails with their three rollers are in each car . There is a slight leakage of air here. ” “ You used the turbo type of blower , did n't you ? ” “ Had to because of the noise . We put some silencing devices on that and yet we could not kill all of the racket . However a new invention has come up that we will make use of soon now. ” “ But I can n't understand , Dutch , why you seemed so put out when I announced my intention of going to Europe via the Tube . Why , I can remember the day when that would have tickled you to death. ” “ You followed the digging of the Tube , did n't you ? ” “ Yes , of course. ” “ You remember the volcano and lava seams ? ” “ Yes. ” “ Well , I do not believe that the crack was a pressure crevice . If it had been , we were far enough below the ocean floor to have partly relieved the situation by the unusually solid building of the Tube . The tremendous shell of this new type of specially hardened metal — ” “ And the rich concrete that was used as filling ! That was one job no one slipped up on . I remember how you watched it — ” “ Yet the crack has widened , Bob , since the Tube was completed. ” “ How can you be certain ? ” “ By the amount of water coming through the drain pipes. ” “ But you said that once more it was stationary. ” “ Yes , and that is the very thing that proves , I believe , the nature of the crack. ” “ I do n't follow you. ” “ Why it is n't a crack at all , Bob . It is an earthquake fault. ” “ Good heavens , you do n't mean — ” “ Yes , I do . I mean that the next time the land slips our little tube will be twisted up like a piece of string , or crushed like an eggshell . That always was a rocky bit of land . I thought in going that far north , though , that we had missed the main line of activity ; I mean the disturbances that had once wiped out a whole nation , if your scientists are correct. ” “ Then you mean that it is only a matter of time ? ” “ Yes , and I have been informed by one expert that the old volcanic activity is not dead either. ” “ So that is what has stolen away your laugh ? ” “ Well I am one of the engineers — and they wo n't suspend the service. ” “ Fate has played an ugly trick on you , Dutch , and through your own dreams too . However , you have made me decide to go by the Tube. ” He took his pipe out of his mouth and stared at me . “ Sooner or later the Tube will be through , and I have never been across . Nothing risked — a dull life . Mine has been altogether too dull . I am now most certainly going by the Tube. ” A bit of the old fire lit up his eyes . “ Same old Bob , ” he grunted as I rose , and then he grasped my hand with a grin . “ Good luck , my boy , on your journey , and may old Vulcan be out on a vacation when you pass his door. ” Thus we said good-by . I did not know then that I would never see him again — that he also took the train that night in order to make one last plea to the International Committee , and so laid down his life with the passengers for whom he had pleaded . It was with many conflicting thoughts , however , that I hurried to the great Terminus that fatal night , where after being ticketed , photographed and tabulated by an efficient army of clerks , I found myself in due time , being ushered to my car of the train . For the benefit of those who have never ridden upon the famous “ Flier , ” I could describe the cars no better than to say that coming upon them by night as I did , they looked like a gigantic , shiny worm , of strange shape , through whose tiny port-holes of heavy glass in the sides , glowed its luminous vitals . I was pompously shown to the front car , which very much resembled a tremendous cartridge — as did all of the other segments of this great glow-worm . Having dismissed the porter with a tip and the suspicion that my having the front car was the work of my friend , who was willing to give me my money 's worth of thrill , and that the porter was aware of this , I stowed away my bags and started to get ready for bed . I had no sooner taken off my coat than the door was opened and an old fellow with a mass of silver hair peered in at me . “ I beg your pardon , sir , but I understand you have engaged this car alone ? ” “ Yes. ” “ I can get no other accommodations tonight . You have an extra berth here and I must get to Paris tomorrow . I will pay you well — ” I smiled . “ Take it . I was beginning to feel lonesome , anyway. ” He bowed gravely and ordered the porter to bring in his things . I decided he was a musician . Only artists go in for such lovely hair . But he undressed in dignified silence , not casting so much as another glance in my direction , while on my part I also forgot his presence when , looking through the port-hole , I realized that the train had begun to move . Soon the drone of the propelling engines began to make itself heard . Then the train began to dip down and the steel sides of the entrance became too high for me to see over . My friend of the silver hair had already turned off the light , and now I knew by the darkness that we had entered the Tube . For some time I lay awake thinking of “ Dutch ” and the ultimate failure of his life 's dream , as he had outlined it to me , and then I sank into a deep , dreamless sleep . I was awakened by a terrible shock that hurled me up against the side of the compartment . A dull , red glow poured through the port-hole , lighting up the interior with a weird , bloody reflection . I crept painfully up to the port-hole and looked out . The strangest sight that man has ever looked upon met my eyes . The side of the wall had blown out into a gigantic cavern , and with it the rest of the cars had rolled down the bluff a tangled , twisted mass of steel . My car had almost passed by , and now it still stuck in the tube , even though the last port-hole through which I peered seemed to be suspended in air . But it was not the wrecked cars from which rose such wails of despair and agony that held my attention , but the cavern itself . For it was not really a cave , but a vast underground city whose wide , marble streets stretched away to an inferno of flame and lava . By the terrible light was lit up a great white palace with its gold-tipped scrolls , and closer to me , the golden temple of the Sun , with its tiers of lustrous yellow stairs — stairs worn by the feet of many generations . Above the stairs towered the great statue of a man on horseback . He was dressed in a sort of tunic , and in his uplifted arm he carried a scroll as if for the people to read . His face was turned toward me , and I marveled even in that wild moment that the unknown sculptor could have caught such an expression of appeal . I can see the high intellectual brow as if it were before me at this moment — the level , sympathetic eyes and the firm chin . Then something moving caught my eyes , and I swear I saw a child — a living child coming from the burning city — running madly , breathlessly from a wave of glowing lava that threatened to engulf him at any moment . In spite of all the ridicule that has been showered upon me , I still declare that the child did not come from the wreckage and that he wore a tunic similar to the one of the statue and not the torn bit of a nightgown or sheet . He was some distance from me , but I could plainly see his expression of wild distraction as he began to climb those gleaming stairs . Strangely lustrous in the weird light , was that worn stairway of gold — gold , the ancient metal of the Sun . With the slowness of one about to faint he dragged himself up , while his breath seemed to be torn from his throat in agonizing gasps . Behind him , the glowing liquid splashed against the steps and the yellow metal of the Sun began to drip into its fiery cauldron . The child reached the leg of the horse and clung there . ... Then suddenly the whole scene began to shake as if I had been looking at a mirage , while just behind my car I had a flashing glimpse in that lurid light of an emerald-green deluge bursting in like a dark sky of solid water , and in that split-second before a crushing blow upon my back , even through that tangle of bedclothes , knocked me into unconsciousness , I seemed to hear again the hopeless note in the voice of my friend as he said : “ — an earthquake fault. ” After what seemed to me aeons of strange , buzzing noises and peculiar lights , I at last made out the objects around me as those of a hospital . Men with serious faces were watching me . I have since been told that I babbled incoherently about “ saving the little fellow ” and other equally incomprehensible murmurings . From them I learned that the train the other way was washed out , a tangled mass of wreckage just like my car , both terminus stations wrecked utterly , and no one found alive except myself . So , although I am to be a hopeless cripple , yet I am not sorry that the skill and untiring patience of the great English surgeon , Dr. Thompson , managed to nurse back the feeble spark of my life through all those weeks that I hung on the borderland ; for if he had not , the world never would have known . As it is , I wonder over the events of that night as if it had not been an experience at all — but a wild weird dream . Even the gentleman with the mass of silver hair is a mystery , for he was never identified , and yet in my mind 's recesses I can still hear his cultured voice asking about the extra berth , and mentioning his pressing mission to Paris . And somehow , he gives the last touch of strangeness to the events of that fatal night , and in my mind , he becomes a part of it no less than the child on the stairs , the burning inferno that lit the background , and the great statue of that unknown hero who held out his scroll for a moment in that lurid light , like a symbol from the sunken City of the Dead . THE END
