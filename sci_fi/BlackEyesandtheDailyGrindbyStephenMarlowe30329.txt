[ Illustration : When Black Eyes needed a nap — everybody slept !] BLACK EYES and the DAILY GRIND By MILTON LESSER The little house pet from Venus did n't like New York , so New York had to change . He liked the flat cracking sound of the gun . He liked the way it slapped back against his shoulder when he fired . Somehow it did not seem a part of the dank , steaming Venusian jungle . Probably , he realized with a smile , it was the only old-fashioned recoil rifle on the entire planet . As if anyone else would want to use one of those old bone-cracking relics today ! But they all failed to realize it made sport much more interesting . “ I have n't seen anything for a while , ” his wife said . She had a young , pretty face and a strong young body . If you have money these days , you could really keep a thirty-five-year-old woman looking trim . Not on Venus , of course . Venus was an outpost , a frontier , a hot , wet , evil-smelling place that beckoned only the big-game hunter . He said , “ That 's true . Yesterday we could bag them one after the other , as fast as I could fire this contraption . Today , if there 's anything bigger than a mouse , it 's hiding in a hole somewhere . You know what I think , Lindy ? ” “ What ? ” “ I think there 's a reason for it . A lot of the early Venusian hunters said there were days like this . An area filled with big lizards and cats and everything else the day before suddenly seems to clear out , for no reason . It does n't make sense. ” “ Why not ? Why could n't they all just decide to make tracks for someplace else on the same day ? ” He slapped at an insect that was buzzing around his right ear , then mopped his sweating brow with a handkerchief . His name was Judd Whitney , and people said he had a lot of money . Now he laughed , patting his wife 's trim shoulder under the white tunic . “ No , Lindy . It just does n't work that way . Not on Earth and not on Venus , either . You think there 's a pied-piper or something which calls all the animals away ? ” “ Maybe . I do n't know much about those things. ” “ No . I do n't think they went anyplace . They 're just quiet . They did n't come out of their holes or hovels or down from the trees . But why ? ” “ Well , let 's forget it . Let 's go back to camp . We can try again tomor — look ! Look , there 's something ! ” Judd followed her pointing finger with his eyes . Half-hidden by the creepers and vines clinging to an old tree-stump , something was watching them . It was n't very big and it seemed in no hurry to get away . “ What is it ? ” Lindy wanted to know . “ Do n't know . Never saw anything like it before . Venus is still an unknown frontier ; the books only name a couple dozen of the biggest animals . But hell , Lindy , that 's not game . I do n't think it weighs five pounds. ” “ It 's cute , and it has a lovely skin. ” Judd could n't argue with that . Squatting on its haunches , the creature was about twenty inches tall . It had a pointed snout and two thin , long ears . Its eyes were very big and very round and quite black . They looked something like the eyes of an Earthian tarsier , but the tarsier were bloody little beasts . The skin was short and stiff and was a kind of silvery white . Under the sheen , however , it seemed to glow . A diamond is colorless , Judd thought , but when you see it under light a whole rainbow of colors sparkle deep within it . This creature 's skin was like that , Judd decided . “ If we could get enough of them , ” Lindy was saying , “ I 'd have the most unusual coat ! Do you think we could find enough , Judd ? ” “ I doubt it . Never saw anything like it before , never heard of anything like it . You 'd need fifty of ‘ em , anyway . Let 's forget about it — too small to shoot , anyway. ” “ No , Judd . I want it. ” “ Well , I 'm not going to stalk a five-pound — hey , wait a minute ! I taught you how to use this rifle , so why do n't you bag it ? ” Lindy grinned . “ That 's a fine idea . I was a little scared of some of those big lizards and cats and everything , but now I 'm going to take you up on it . Here , give me your gun. ” Judd removed the leather thong from his shoulder and handed the weapon to her . She looked at it a little uncertainly , then took the clip of shells which Judd offered and slammed it into the chamber . The little creature sat unmoving . “ Is n't it peculiar that it does n't run away , Judd ? ” “ Sure is . Nothing formidable about that animal , so unless it has a hidden poison somewhere , just about anything in this swamp could do it in . To survive it would have to be fast as hell and it would have to keep running all the time . Beats me , Lindy. ” “ Well , I 'm going to get myself one pelt toward that coat , anyway . Watch , Judd : is this the way ? ” She lifted the rifle to her shoulder and squinted down the sights toward the shining creature . “ Yeah , that 's the way . Only relax . Relax . Shoulder 's so tense you 're liable to dislocate it with the kick . There — that 's better. ” Now Lindy 's finger was wrapped around the trigger and she remembered Judd had told her to squeeze it , not to pull it . If you pulled the trigger you jerked the rifle and spoiled your aim . You had to squeeze it slowly .... The animal seemed politely interested . Suddenly , a delicious languor stole over Lindy . It possessed her all at once and she had no idea where it came from . Her legs had been stiff and tired from the all-morning trek through the swamp , but now they felt fine . Her whole body was suffused in a warm , satisfied glow of well-being . And laziness . It was an utterly new sensation and she could even feel it tingling at the roots of her hair . She sighed and lowered the rifle . “ I do n't want to shoot it , ” she said . “ You just told me you did. ” “ I know , but I changed my mind . What 's the matter , can n't I change my mind ? ” “ Of course you can change your mind . But I thought you wanted a coat of those things. ” “ Yes , I suppose I do . But I do n't want to shoot it , that 's all. ” Judd snorted . “ I think you have a streak of softness someplace in that pretty head of yours ! ” “ Maybe . I do n't know . But I 'd still like the pelt . Funny , is n't it ? ” “ Okay , okay ! But do n't ask to use the gun again. ” Judd snatched it from her hands . “ If you do n't want to shoot it , then I will . Maybe we can make you a pair of gloves or something from the pelt. ” And Judd pointed his ancient rifle at the little animal preparing to snap off a quick shot . It would be a cinch at this distance . Even Lindy would n't have missed , if she had n't changed her mind . Judd yawned . He 'd failed to realize he was so tired . Not an aching kind of tiredness , but the kind that makes you feel good all over . He yawned again and lowered the rifle . “ Changed my mind , ” he said . “ I do n't want to shoot it , either . What say we head back for camp ? ” Lindy gripped his hand impulsively . “ All right , Judd — but I had a brainstorm ! I want it for a pet ! ” “ A pet ? ” “ Yes . I think it would be the cutest thing . Everyone would look and wonder and I 'll adore it ! ” “ We do n't know anything about it . Maybe Earth would be too cold , or too dry , or maybe we do n't have anything it can eat . There are liable to be a hundred different strains of bacteria that can kill it. ” “ I said I want it for a pet . See ? Look at it ! We can call it Black Eyes. ” “ Black Eyes — ” Judd groaned . “ Yes , Black Eyes . If you do n't do this one thing for me , Judd — ” “ Okay — okay . But I 'm not going to do anything . You want it , you take it. ” Lindy frowned , looked at him crossly , then sloshed across the swamp toward Black Eyes . The creature waited on its stump until she came quite close , and then , with a playful little bound , it hopped onto her shoulder , still squatting on its haunches . Lindy squealed excitedly and began to stroke its silvery fur . A month later , they returned to Earth . Judd and Lindy and Black Eyes . The hunting trip had been a success — Judd 's trophies were on their way home on a slow freighter , and he 'd have some fine heads and skins for his study-room . Even Black Eyes had been no trouble at all . It ate scraps from their table , forever sitting on its haunches and staring at them with its big black eyes . Judd thought it would make one helluva lousy pet , but he did n't tell Lindy . Trouble was , it never did anything . It merely sat still , or occasionally it would bounce down to the floor and mince along on its hind-legs for a scrap of food . It never uttered a sound . It did not frolic and it did not gambol . Most of the time it could have been carved from stone . But Lindy was happy and Judd said nothing . They had a little trouble with the customs officials . This because nothing unknown could be brought to Earth without a thorough examination . At the customs office , a bespectacled official stared at Black Eyes , scratching his head . “ Never seen one like that before. ” “ Neither have I , ” Judd admitted . “ Well , I 'll look in the book. ” The man did , but there are no thorough tomes on Venusian fauna . “ Not here. ” “ I could have told you. ” “ Well , we 'll have to quarantine it and study it . That means you and your wife go into quarantine , too . It could have something that 's catching. ” “ Absurd ! ” Lindy cried . “ Sorry , lady . I only work here. ” “ You and your bright ideas , ” Judd told his wife acidly . “ We may be quarantined a month until they satisfy themselves about Black Eyes. ” The customs official shrugged his bony shoulders , and Judd removed a twenty-credit note from his pocket and handed it to the man . “ Will this change your mind ? ” “ I should say not ! You can n't bribe me , Mr. Whitney ! You can n't — ” The man yawned , stretched languidly , smiled . “ No , sir , you can keep your money , Mr. Whitney . Guess we do n't have to examine your pet after all . Mighty cute little feller . Well , have fun with it . Come on , move along now. ” And , as they were departing with Black Eyes , still not believing their ears : “ Darn this weather ! Makes a man so lazy .... ” It was after the affair at the customs office , that Black Eyes uttered its first sound . City life has n't changed much in the last fifty years . Jet-cars still streak around the circumferential highways , their whistles blaring . Factories still belch smoke and steam , although the new atomic power plants have lessened that to a certain extent . Crowds still throng the streets , noisy , hurrying , ill-mannered . It 's one of those things that can n't be helped . A city has to live , and it has to make noise . But it seemed to frighten Lindy 's new pet . It stared through the jet-car window on the way from the spaceport to the Whitneys ’ suburban home , its black eyes welling with tears . “ Look ! ” Judd exclaimed . “ Black Eyes can cry ! ” “ A crying pet , Judd . I knew there would be something unusual about Black Eyes , I just knew it ! ” The tears in the big black eyes overflowed and tumbled out , rolling down Black Eyes ’ silvery cheeks . And then Black Eyes whimpered . It was only a brief whimper , but both Judd and Lindy heard it , and even the driver turned around for a moment and stared at the animal . The driver stopped the jet . He yawned and rested his head comfortably on the cushioned seat . He went quietly to sleep . A man named Merrywinkle owned the Merrywinkle Shipping Service . That , in itself , was not unusual . But at precisely the moment that Black Eyes unleashed its mild whimper , Mr. Merrywinkle — uptown and five miles away — called an emergency conference of the board of directors and declared : “ Gentlemen , we have all been working too hard , and I , for one , am going to take a vacation . I do n't know when I 'll be back , but it wo n't be before six months. ” “ But C. M ., ” someone protested . “ There 's the Parker deal and the Gilette contract and a dozen other things . You 're needed ! ” Mr. Merrywinkle shook his bald head . “ What 's more , you 're all taking vacations , with pay . Six months , each of you . We 're closing down Merrywinkle Shipping for half a year . Give the competition a break , eh ? ” “ But C. M .! We 're about ready to squeeze out Chambers Parcel Co .! They 'll get back on their feet in six months. ” “ Never mind . Notify all departments of the shut-down , effective immediately . Vacations for all. ” “ Who shut off the assembly belt ? ” the foreman asked mildly . He was not a mild man and he usually stormed and ranted at the slightest provocation . This was at Clewson Jetcraft , and you could n't produce a single jet-plane without the assembly belt , naturally . A plump little man said , “ I did. ” “ But why ? ” the foreman asked him , smiling blandly . “ I do n't know . I just did. ” The foreman was still smiling . “ I do n't blame you. ” Two days later , Clewson Jetcraft had to lay off all its help . They put ads in all the papers seeking new personnel but no one showed up . Clewson was forced to shut down . The crack Boston to New York pneumo-tube commuter 's special pulled to a bone-jarring stop immediately outside the New York station . Some angry commuters pried open the conductor 's cab , and found the man snoozing quite contentedly . They awakened him , but he refused to drive the train any further . All the commuters had to leave the pneumo-train and edge their way along three miles of catwalk to the station . No one was very happy about it , but the feeling of well-being which came over them all nipped any possible protest in the bud . Black Eyes whimpered again when Judd and Lindy reached home but after that it was quiet . It just sat on its haunches near the window and stared out at the city . The quiet city . Nothing moved in the streets . Nothing stirred . People remained at home watching local video or the new space-video from Mars . At first it was a good joke , and the newspapers could have had a field day with it , had the newspapers remained in circulation . After four days , however , they suspended publication . On the fifth day , there was a shortage of food in the city , great stores of it spoiling in the warehouses . Heat and light failed after a week , and the fire department ignored all alarms a day later . But everything did not stop . School teachers still taught their classes ; clerks still sold whatever goods were left on local shelves . Librarians were still at their desks . Conservatives said it was a liberal plot to undermine capital and demand higher wages ; liberals said big business could afford the temporary layoff and wanted to squeeze out the small businessman and labor unions . Scientists pondered and city officials made speeches over video . “ Something , ” one of them observed , “ has hit our city . Work that requires anything above a modicum of sound has become impossible ; in regards to such work people have become lazy . No one can offer any valid suggestions concerning the malady . It merely exists . However , if a stop is not put to it — and soon — our fair city will disintegrate . Something is making us lazy , and that laziness can spell doom , being a compulsive lack of desire to create any noise or disturbance . If anyone believes he has the solution , he should contact the Department of Science at once . If you can n't use the video-phone , come in person . But come ! Every hour which passes adds to the city 's woes. ” Nothing but scatter-brained ideas for a week , none of them worth consideration . Then the bespectacled customs official who had bypassed quarantine for Black Eyes , got in touch with the authorities . He had always been a conscientious man — except for that one lapse . Maybe the queer little beast had nothing to do with this crisis . But then again , the customs official had never before — or since — had that strange feeling of lassitude . Could there be some connection ? A staff of experts on extra-terrestrial fauna was dispatched to the Whitney residence , although , indeed , the chairman of the Department of Science secretly considered the whole idea ridiculous . The staff of experts introduced themselves . Then , ignoring the protests of Lindy , went to work on Black Eyes . At first Judd thought the animal would object , but apparently it did not . While conditions all about them in the city worsened , the experts spent three days studying Black Eyes . They found nothing out of the ordinary . Black Eyes merely stared back at them , and but for an accident , they would have departed without a lead . On the third day , a huge mongrel dog which belonged to the Whitneys ’ next-door neighbors somehow slipped its leash . It was a fierce and ugly animal , and it was known to attack anything smaller than itself . It jumped the fence and landed in Judd Whitney 's yard . A few loping bounds took it through an open window , ground level . Inside , it spied Black Eyes and made for the creature at once , howling furiously . Black Eyes did n't budge . And the mongrel changed its mind ! The slavering tongue withdrew inside the chops , the howling stopped . The mongrel lay down on the floor and whined . Presently it lost all interest , got to its feet , and left as it had come . Other animals were brought to the Whitney home . Cats . Dogs . A lion from the city zoo , starved for two days and brought in a special mobile cage by its keeper . Black Eyes was thrust into the cage and the lion gave forth with a hideous yowling . Soon it stopped , rolled over , and slept . The scientists correlated their reports , returned with them to the Whitney house . The leader , whose name was Jamison , said : “ As closely as we can tell , Black Eyes is the culprit. ” “ What ? ” Lindy demanded . “ Yes , Mrs. Whitney . Your pet , Black Eyes. ” “ Oh , I do n't believe it ! ” But Judd said , “ Go ahead , Dr. Jamison . I 'm listening. ” “ Well , how does an animal — any animal — protect itself ? ” “ Why , in any number of ways . If it has claws or a strong jaw and long teeth , it can fight . If it is fleet of foot , it can run . If it is big and has a tough hide , most other animals can n't hurt it anyway . Umm-mm , does n't that about cover it ? ” “ You left out protective coloration , defensive odors , and things like that . Actually , those are most important from our point of view , for Black Eyes ’ ability is a further ramification of that sort of thing . Your pet is not fast . It is n't strong . It can n't change color and it has no offensive odor to chase off predatory enemies . It has no armor . In short , can you think of a more helpless creature to put down in those Venusian swamps ? ” After Judd had shaken his head , Dr. Jamison continued : “ Very well , Black Eyes should not be able to survive on Venus — and yet , obviously the creature did . We can assume there are more of the breed , too . Anyway , Black Eyes survives . And I 'll tell you why . “ Black Eyes has a very uncommon ability to sense danger when it approaches . And sensing danger , Black Eyes can thwart it . Your creature sends out certain emanations — I wo n't pretend to know what they are — which stamp aggression out of any predatory creatures . Neither of you could fire upon it — right ? ” “ Umm-mm , that 's true , ” Judd said . Lindy nodded . “ Well , that 's one half of it . There 's so much about life we do n't understand . Black Eyes uses energy of an unknown intensity , and the result maintains Black Eyes ’ life . Now , although that is the case , your animal did not live a comfortable life in the Venusian swamp . Because no animal would attack it , it could not be harmed . Still , from what you tell me about that swamp ... “ Anyhow , Black Eyes was glad to come away with you , and everything went well until you landed in New York . The noises , the clattering , the continual bustle of a great city — all this frightened the creature . It was being attacked — or , at least that 's what it must have figured . Result : it struck back the only way it knew how . Have you ever heard about sub-sonic sound-waves , Mr. Whitney , waves of sound so low that our ears cannot pick them up — waves of sound which can nevertheless stir our emotions ? Such things exist , and , as a working hypothesis , I would say Black Eyes ’ strange powers rest along those lines . The whole city is idle because Black Eyes is afraid ! ” In his exploration of Mars , of Venus , of the Jovian moons , Judd Whitney had seen enough of extra-terrestrial life to know that virtually anything was possible , and Black Eyes would be no exception to that rule . “ What do you propose to do ? ” Judd demanded . “ Do ? Why , we 'll have to kill your creature , naturally . You can set a value on it and we will meet it , but Black Eyes must die. ” “ No ! ” Lindy cried . “ You can n't be sure , you 're only guessing , and it is n't fair ! ” “ My dear woman , do n't you realize this is a serious situation ? The city 's people will starve in time . No one can even bring food in because the trucks make too much noise ! As an alternative , we could evacuate , but is your pet more valuable than the life of a great city ? ” “ N-no .... ” “ Then , please ! Listen to reason ! ” “ Kill it , ” Judd said . “ Go ahead. ” Dr. Jamison withdrew from his pocket a small blasting pistol used by the Department of Domestic Animals for elimination of injured creatures . He advanced on Black Eyes , who sat on its haunches in the center of the room , surveying the scientist . Dr. Jamison put his blaster away . “ I can n't , ” he said . “ I do n't want to. ” Judd smiled . “ I know it . No one — no thing — can kill Black Eyes . You said so yourself . It was a waste of time to try it . In that case — ” “ In that case , ” Dr. Jamison finished for him , “ we 're helpless . There is n't a man — or an animal — on Earth that will destroy this thing . Wait a minute — does it sleep , Mr. Whitney ? ” “ I do n't think so . At least , I never saw it sleep . And your team of scientists , did they report anything ? ” “ No . As far as they could see , the creature never slept . We can n't catch it unawares. ” “ Could you anesthetize it ? ” “ How ? It can sense danger , and long before you could do that , it would stop you . It 's only made one mistake , Mr. Whitney : it believes the noises of the city represent a danger . And that 's only a negative mistake . Noise wo n't hurt Black Eyes , of course . It simply makes the animal unnecessarily cautious . But we cannot anesthetize it any more than we can kill it. ” “ I could take it back to Venus. ” “ Could you ? Could you ? I had n't thought of that. ” Judd shook his head . “ I can n't. ” “ What do you mean you can n't ? ” “ It wo n't let me . Somehow it can sense our thoughts when we think something it does n't want . I can n't take it to Venus ! No man could , because it does n't want to go. ” “ My dear Mr. Whitney — do you mean to say you believe it can think ? ” “ Uh-uh . Did n't say that . It can sense our thoughts , and that 's something else again. ” Dr. Jamison threw his hands up over his head in a dramatic gesture . “ It 's hopeless , ” he said . Things grew worse . New York crawled along to a standstill . People began to move from the city . In trickles , at first , but the trickles became torrents , as New York 's ten million people began to depart for saner places . It might take months — it might even take years , but the exodus had begun . Nothing could stop it . Because of a harmless little beast with the eyes of a tarsier , the life of a great city was coming to an end . Word spread . Scientists all over the world studied reports on Black Eyes . No one had any ideas . Everyone was stumped . Black Eyes had no particular desire to go outside . Black Eyes merely remained in the Whitney house , contemplating nothing in particular , and stopping everything . Dr. Jamison , however , was a persistent man . Judd got a letter from him one day , and the following afternoon he kept his appointment with the scientist . “ It 's good to get out , ” Judd said , after a three hour walk to the Department of Science Building . “ I can go crazy just staring at that thing. ” “ I have it , Whitney. ” “ You have what ? Not the way to destroy Black Eyes ? I do n't believe it ! ” “ It 's true . Consider . Everyone in the world does not yet know of your pet , correct ? ” “ I suppose there are a few people who do n't — ” “ There are many . Among them , are the crew of a jet-bomber which has been on maneuvers in Egypt . We have arranged everything. ” “ Yes ? How ? ” “ At noon tomorrow , the bomber will appear over your home with one of the ancient , high-explosive missiles . Your neighbors will be removed from the vicinity , and , precisely at twelve-o-three in the afternoon , the bomb will be dropped . Your home will be destroyed . Black Eyes will be destroyed with it. ” Judd looked uncomfortable . “ I dunno , ” he said . “ Sounds too easy. ” “ Too easy ? I doubt if the animal will ever sense what is going on — not when the crew of the bomber does n't know , either . They 'll consider it a mighty peculiar order , to destroy one harmless , rather large and rather elaborate suburban home . But they 'll do it . See you tomorrow , Whitney , after this mess is behind us. ” “ Yeah , ” Judd said . “ Yeah. ” But somehow , the scientist had failed to instill any of his confidence in Judd . With Lindy , he left home at eleven the following morning , after making a thorough list of all their properties which the City had promised to duplicate . Judd did not look at Black Eyes as he left , and the animal remained where it was , seated on its haunches under the dining room table , nibbling crumbs . Judd could almost feel the big round eyes boring a pair of twin holes in his back , and he dared not turn around to face them .... They were a mile away at eleven forty-five , making their way through the nearly deserted streets . Judd stopped walking . He looked at Lindy . Lindy looked at him . “ They 're going to destroy it , ” he said . “ I know. ” “ Do you want them to ? ” “ I — I — ” Judd knew that something had to be done with Black Eyes . He did n't like the little beast , and , anyway , that had nothing to do with it . Black Eyes was a menace . And yet , something whispered in Judd 's ear , Do n't let them , do n't let them ... It was n't Judd and it was n't Judd 's subconscious . It was Black Eyes , and he knew it . But he could n't do a thing about it — “ I 'm going to stay right here and let them bomb the place , ” he said aloud . But as he spoke , he was running back the way he had come . Fifteen minutes . He sprinted part of the time , then rested , then sprinted again . He was somewhat on the beefy side and he could not run fast , but he made it . Just . He heard the jet streaking through the sky overhead , looked up once and saw it circling . Two blocks from his house he was met by a policeman . The entire area had been roped off , and the officer shook his head when Judd tried to get through . “ But I live there ! ” “ Ca n't help it , Mister . Orders is orders. ” Judd hit him . Judd did n't want to , but nevertheless , he grunted with satisfaction when he felt the blow to be a good one , catching the stocky officer on the point of his chin and tumbling him over backwards . Then Judd was ducking under the rope and running . He reached his house , plummeted in through the front door . He found Black Eyes under the kitchen table , squatting on its haunches . He scooped the animal up , ran outside . Then he was running again , and before he reached the barrier , something rocked him . A loud series of explosions ripped through his brain , and instinctively — Black Eyes ’ instincts , not his — he folded his arms over the animal , protecting it . Something shuddered and began to fall behind him , and debris scattered in all directions . Something struck Judd 's head and he felt the ground slapping up crazily at his face — He was as good as new a few days later . And so was Black Eyes . “ I have it , ” Judd said to his nurse . “ You have what , sir ? ” “ It 's so simple , so ridiculously simple , maybe that 's why no one ever thought of it . Get me Dr. Jamison ! ” Jamison came a few moments later , breathless . “ Well ? ” “ I have the solution. ” “ You ... do ? ” Not much hope in the answer . Dr. Jamison was a tired , defeated man . “ Sure . Black Eyes does n't like the city . Fine . Take him out . I can n't take him to Venus . He does n't like Venus and he wo n't go . No one can take him anyplace he does n't want to go , just as no one can hurt him in any way . But he does n't like the city . It 's too noisy . All right : have someone take him far from the city , far far away — where there 's no noise at all . Someplace out in the sticks where it wo n't matter much if Black Eyes puts a stop to any disturbing noises. ” “ Who will take him ? You , Mr. Whitney ? ” Judd shook his head . “ That 's your job , not mine . I 've given you the answer . Now use it. ” Lindy had arrived , and Lindy said : “ Judd , you 're right . That is the answer . And you 're wonderful — ” No one volunteered to spend his life in exile with Black Eyes , but then Dr. Jamison pointed out that while no one knew the creature 's life-span , it certainly could n't be expected to match man 's . Just a few years and the beast would die , and ... Dr. Jamison 's arguments were so logical that he convinced himself . He took Black Eyes with him into the Canadian Northwoods , and there they live . Judd was right — almost . This was the obvious answer which escaped everyone . But scientists continued their examinations of Black Eyes , and they discovered something . Black Eyes ’ fears had not been for herself alone . She is going to have babies . The estimate is for thirty-five little tarsier-eyed creatures . No doctor in the world will be able to do anything but deliver the litter . THE END
