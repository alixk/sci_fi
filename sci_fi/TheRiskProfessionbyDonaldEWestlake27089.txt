[ Illustration : Illustrated by IVIE ] The men who did dangerous work had a special kind of insurance policy . But when somebody wanted to collect on that policy , the claims investigator suddenly became a member of ... The RISK PROFESSION By DONALD E. WESTLAKE Mister Henderson called me into his office my third day back in Tangiers . That was a day and a half later than I 'd expected . Roving claims investigators for Tangiers Mutual Insurance Corporation do n't usually get to spend more than thirty-six consecutive hours at home base . Henderson was jovial but stern . That meant he was happy with the job I 'd just completed , and that he was pretty sure I 'd find some crooked shenanigans on this next assignment . That did n't please me . I 'm basically a plain-living type , and I hate complications . I almost wished for a second there that I was back on Fire and Theft in Greater New York . But I knew better than that . As a roving claim investigator , I avoided the more stultifying paper work inherent in this line of work and had the additional luxury of an expense account nobody ever questioned . It made working for a living almost worthwhile . When I was settled in the chair beside his desk , Henderson said , “ That was good work you did on Luna , Ged . Saved the company a pretty pence. ” I smiled modestly and said , “ Thank you , sir. ” And reflected to myself for the thousandth time that the company could do worse than split that saving with the guy who 'd made it possible . Me , in other words . “ Got a tricky one this time , Ged , ” said my boss . He had done his back-patting , now we got down to business . He peered keenly at me , or at least as keenly as a round-faced tiny-eyed fat man can peer . “ What do you know about the Risk Profession Retirement Plan ? ” he asked me . “ I 've heard of it , ” I said truthfully . “ That 's about all. ” He nodded . “ Most of the policies are sold off-planet , of course . It 's a form of insurance for non-insurables . Spaceship crews , asteroid prospectors , people like that. ” “ I see , ” I said , unhappily . I knew right away this meant I was going to have to go off-Earth again . I 'm a one-gee boy all the way . Gravity changes get me in the solar plexus . I get g-sick at the drop of an elevator . “ Here 's the way it works , ” he went on , either not noticing my sad face or choosing to ignore it . “ The client pays a monthly premium . He can be as far ahead or as far behind in his payments as he wants — the policy has no lapse clause — just so he 's all paid up by the Target Date . The Target Date is a retirement age , forty-five or above , chosen by the client himself . After the Target Date , he stops paying premiums , and we begin to pay him a monthly retirement check , the amount determined by the amount paid into the policy , his age at retiring , and so on . Clear ? ” I nodded , looking for the gimmick that made this a paying proposition for good old Tangiers Mutual . “ The Double R-P — that 's what we call it around the office here — assures the client that he wo n't be reduced to panhandling in his old age , should his other retirement plans fall through . For Belt prospectors , of course , this means the big strike , which maybe one in a hundred find . For the man who never does make that big strike , this is something to fall back on . He can come home to Earth and retire , with a guaranteed income for the rest of his life. ” I nodded again , like a good company man . “ Of course , ” said Henderson , emphasizing this point with an upraised chubby finger , “ these men are still uninsurables . This is a retirement plan only , not an insurance policy . There is no beneficiary other than the client himself. ” And there was the gimmick . I knew a little something of the actuarial statistics concerning uninsurables , particularly Belt prospectors . Not many of them lived to be forty-five , and the few who would survive the Belt and come home to collect the retirement would n't last more than a year or two . A man who 's spent the last twenty or thirty years on low-gee asteroids just shrivels up after a while when he tries to live on Earth . It needed a company like Tangiers Mutual to dream up a racket like that . The term “ uninsurables ” to most insurance companies means those people whose jobs or habitats make them too likely as prospects for obituaries . To Tangiers Mutual , uninsurables are people who have money the company can n't get at . “ Now , ” said Henderson importantly , “ we come to the problem at hand. ” He ruffled his up-to-now-neat In basket and finally found the folder he wanted . He studied the blank exterior of this folder for a few seconds , pursing his lips at it , and said , “ One of our clients under the Double R-P was a man named Jafe McCann. ” “ Was ? ” I echoed . He squinted at me , then nodded at my sharpness . “ That 's right , he 's dead. ” He sighed heavily and tapped the folder with all those pudgy fingers . “ Normally , ” he said , “ that would be the end of it . File closed . However , this time there are complications. ” Naturally . Otherwise , he would n't be telling me about it . But Henderson could n't be rushed , and I knew it . I kept the alert look on my face and thought of other things , while waiting for him to get to the point . “ Two weeks after Jafe McCann 's death , ” Henderson said , “ we received a cash-return form on his policy. ” “ A cash-return form ? ” I 'd never heard of such a thing . It did n't sound like anything Tangiers Mutual would have anything to do with . We never return cash . “ It 's something special in this case , ” he explained . “ You see , this is n't an insurance policy , it 's a retirement plan , and the client can withdraw from the retirement plan at any time , and have seventy-five per cent of his paid-up premiums returned to him . It 's , uh , the law in plans such as this. ” “ Oh , ” I said . That explained it . A law that had snuck through the World Finance Code Commission while the insurance lobby was n't looking . “ But you see the point , ” said Henderson . “ This cash-return form arrived two weeks after the client 's death. ” “ You said there were n't any beneficiaries , ” I pointed out . “ Of course . But the form was sent in by the man 's partner , one Ab Karpin . McCann left a hand-written will bequeathing all his possessions to Karpin . Since , according to Karpin , this was done before McCann 's death , the premium money cannot be considered part of the policy , but as part of McCann 's cash-on-hand . And Karpin wants it. ” “ It can n't be that much , can it ? ” I asked . I was trying my best to point out to him that the company would spend more than it would save if it sent me all the way out to the asteroids , a prospect I could feel coming and one which I was n't ready to cry hosannah over . “ McCann died , ” Henderson said ponderously , “ at the age of fifty-six . He had set his retirement age at sixty . He took out the policy at the age of thirty-four , with monthly payments of fifty credits . Figure it out for yourself. ” I did — in my head — and came up with a figure of thirteen thousand and two hundred credits . Seventy-five per cent of that would be nine thousand and nine hundred credits . Call it ten thousand credits even . I had to admit it . It was worth the trip . “ I see , ” I said sadly . “ Now , ” said Henderson , “ the conditions — the circumstances — of McCann 's death are somewhat suspicious . And so is the cash-return form itself. ” “ There 's a chance it 's a forgery ? ” “ One would think so , ” he said . “ But our handwriting experts have worn themselves out with that form , comparing it with every other single scrap of McCann 's writing they can find . And their conclusion is that not only is it genuinely McCann 's handwriting , but it is McCann 's handwriting at age fifty-six. ” “ So McCann must have written it , ” I said . “ Under duress , do you think ? ” “ I have no idea , ” said Henderson complacently . “ That 's what you 're supposed to find out . Oh , there 's just one more thing. ” I did my best to make my ears perk . “ I told you that McCann 's death occurred under somewhat suspicious circumstances. ” “ Yes , ” I agreed , “ you did. ” “ McCann and Karpin , ” he said , “ have been partners — unincorporated , of course — for the last fifteen years . They had found small rare-metal deposits now and again , but they had never found that one big strike all the Belt prospectors waste their lives looking for . Not until the day before McCann died. ” “ Ah hah , ” I said . “ Then they found the big strike. ” “ Exactly. ” “ And McCann 's death ? ” “ Accidental. ” “ Sure , ” I said . “ What proof have we got ? ” “ None . The body is lost in space . And law is few and far between that far out. ” “ So all we 've got is this guy Karpin 's word for how McCann died , is that it ? ” “ That 's all we have . So far. ” “ Sure . And now you want me to go on out there and find out what 's cooking , and see if I can maybe save the company ten thousand credits. ” “ Exactly , ” said Henderson . The copter took me to the spaceport west of Cairo , and there I boarded the good ship Demeter for Luna City and points Out . I loaded up on g-sickness pills and they worked fine . I was sick as a dog . By the time we got to Atronics City , my insides had grown resigned to their fate . As long as I did n't try to eat , my stomach would leave me alone . Atronics City was about as depressing as a Turkish bath with all the lights on . It stood on a chunk of rock a couple of miles thick , and it looked like nothing more in this world than a welder 's practice range . From the outside , Atronics City is just a derby-shaped dome of nickel-iron , black and kind of dirty-looking . I suppose a transparent dome would have been more fun , but the builders of the company cities in the asteroids were businessmen , and they were n't concerned with having fun . There 's nothing to look at outside the dome but chunks of rock and the blackness of space anyway , and you 've got all this cheap iron floating around in the vicinity , and all a dome 's supposed to do is keep the air in . Besides , though the Belt is n't as crowded as a lot of people think , there is quite a lot of debris rushing here and there , bumping into things , and a transparent dome would just get all scratched up , not to mention punctured . From the inside , Atronics City is even jollier . There 's the top level , directly under the dome , which is mainly parking area for scooters and tuggers of various kinds , plus the office shacks of the Assayer 's Office , the Entry Authority , the Industry Troopers and so on . The next three levels have all been burned into the bowels of the planetoid . Level two is the Atronics plant , and a noisy plant it is . Level three is the shopping and entertainment area — grocery stores and clothing stores and movie theaters and bars — and level four is housing , two rooms and kitchen for the unmarried , four rooms and kitchen plus one room for each child for the married . All of these levels have one thing in common . Square corners , painted olive drab . The total effect of the place is suffocating . You feel like you 're stuck in the middle of a stack of packing crates . Most of the people living in Atronics City work , of course , for International Atronics , Incorporated . The rest of them work in the service occupations — running the bars and grocery stores and so on — that keep the company employees alive and relatively happy . Wages come high in the places like Atronics City . Why not , the raw materials come practically for free . And as for working conditions , well , take a for instance . How do you make a vacuum tube ? You fiddle with the innards and surround it all with glass . And how do you get the air out ? No problem , boy , there was n't any air in there to begin with . At any rate , there I was at Atronics City . That was as far as Demeter would take me . Now , while the ship went on to Ludlum City and Chemisant City and the other asteroid business towns , my two suitcases and I dribbled down the elevator to my hostelry on level four . Have you ever taken an elevator ride when the gravity is practically non-existent ? Well , do n't . You see , the elevator manages to sink faster than you do . It is n't being lowered down to level four , it 's being pulled down . What this means is that the suitcases have to be lashed down with the straps provided , and you and the operator have to hold on tight to the hand-grips placed here and there around the wall . Otherwise , you 'd clonk your head on the ceiling . But we got to level four at last , and off I went with my suitcases and the operator 's directions . The suitcases weighed about half an ounce each out here , and I felt as though I weighed the same . Every time I raised a foot , I was sure I was about to go sailing into a wall . Local citizens eased by me , their feet occasionally touching the iron pavement as they soared along , and I gave them all dirty looks . Level four was nothing but walls and windows . The iron floor went among these walls and windows in a straight straight line , bisecting other “ streets ” at perfect right angles , and the iron ceiling sixteen feet up was lined with a double row of fluorescent tubes . I was beginning to feel claustrophobic already . The Chalmers Hotel — named for an Atronics vice-president — had received my advance registration , which was nice . I was shown to a second-floor room — nothing on level four had more than two stories — and was left to unpack my suitcases as best I may . I had decided to spend a day or two at Atronics City before taking a scooter out to Ab Karpin 's claim . Atronics City had been Karpin 's and McCann 's home base . All of McCann 's premium payments had been mailed from here , and the normal mailing address for both of them was GPO Atronics City . I wanted to know as much as possible about Ab Karpin before I went out to see him . And Atronics City seemed like the best place to get my information . But not today . Today , my stomach was very unhappy , and my head was on sympathy strike . Today , I was going to spend my time exclusively in bed , trying not to float up to the ceiling . The Mapping & Registry Office , it seemed to me the next day , was the best place to start . This was where prospectors filed their claims , but it was a lot more than that . The waiting room of M & R was the unofficial club of the asteroid prospectors . This is where they met with one another , talked together about the things that prospectors discuss , and made and dissolved their transient partnerships . In this way , Karpin and McCann were unusual . They had maintained their partnership for fifteen years . That was about sixty times longer than most such arrangements lasted . Searching the asteroid chunks for rare and valuable metals is basically pretty lonely work , and it 's inevitable that the prospectors will every once in a while get hungry for human company and decide to try a team operation . But , at the same time , work like this attracts people who do n't get along very well with human company . So the partnerships come and go , and the hatreds flare and are forgotten , and the normal prospecting team lasts an average of three months . At any rate , it was to the Mapping & Registry Office that I went first . And , since that office was up on the first level , I went by elevator . Riding up in that elevator was a heck of a lot more fun than riding down . The elevator whipped up like mad , the floor pressed against the soles of my feet , and it felt almost like good old Earth for a second or two there . But then the elevator stopped , and I held on tight to the hand-grips to keep from shooting through the top of the blasted thing . The operator — a phlegmatic sort — gave me directions to the M & R , and off I went , still trying to figure out how to sail along as gracefully as the locals . The Mapping & Registry Office occupied a good-sized shack over near the dome wall , next to the entry lock . I pushed open the door and went on in . The waiting room was cozy and surprisingly large , large enough to comfortably hold the six maroon leather sofas scattered here and there on the pale green carpet , flanked by bronze ashtray stands . There were only six prospectors here at the moment , chatting together in two groups of three , and they all looked alike . Grizzled , ageless , watery-eyed , their clothing clean but baggy . I passed them and went on to the desk at the far end , behind which sat a young man in official gray , slowly turning the crank of a microfilm reader . He looked up at my approach . I flashed my company identification and asked to speak to the manager . He went away , came back , and ushered me into an office which managed to be Spartan and sumptuous at the same time . The walls had been plastic-painted in textured brown , the iron floor had been lushly carpeted in gray , and the desk had been covered with a simulated wood coating . The manager — a man named Teaking — went well with the office . His face and hands were spare and lean , but his uniform was immaculate , covered with every curlicue the regulations allowed . He welcomed me politely , but curiously , and I said , “ I wonder if you know a prospector named Ab Karpin ? ” “ Karpin ? Of course . He and old Jafe McCann — pity about McCann . I hear he got killed. ” “ Yes , he did. ” “ And that 's what you 're here for , eh ? ” He nodded sagely . “ I did n't know the Belt boys could get insurance , ” he said . “ It is n't exactly that , ” I said . “ This concerns a retirement plan , and — well , the details do n't matter. ” Which , I hoped , would end his curiosity in that line . “ I was hoping you could give me some background on Karpin . And on McCann , too , for that matter. ” He grinned a bit . “ You saw the men sitting outside ? ” I nodded . “ Then you 've seen Karpin and McCann . Exactly the same . It does n't matter if a man 's thirty or sixty or what . It does n't matter what he was like before he came out here . If he 's been here a few years , he looks exactly like the bunch you saw outside there. ” “ That 's appearance , ” I said . “ What I was looking for was personality. ” “ Same thing , ” he said . “ All of them . Close-mouthed , anti-social , fiercely independent , incurably romantic , always convinced that the big strike is just a piece of rock away . McCann , now , he was a bit more realistic than most . He 'd be the one I 'd expect to take out a retirement policy . A real pence-pincher , that one , though I should n't say it as he 's dead . But that 's the way he was . Brighter than most Belt boys when it came to money matters . I 've seen him haggle over a new piece of equipment for their scooter , or some repair work , or some such thing , and he was a wonder to watch. ” “ And Karpin ? ” I asked him . “ A prospector , ” he said , as though that answered my question . “ Same as everybody else . Not as sharp as McCann when it came to money . That 's why all the money stuff in the partnership was handled by McCann . But Karpin was one of the sharpest boys in the business when it came to mineralogy . He knew rocks you and I never heard of , and most times he knew them by sight . Almost all of the Belt boys are college grads — you 've got to know what you 're looking for out here and what it looks like when you 've found it — but Karpin has practically all of them beat . He 's sharp. ” “ Sounds like a good team , ” I said . “ I guess that 's why they stayed together so long , ” he said . “ They complemented each other. ” He leaned forward , the inevitable prelude to a confidential remark . “ I 'll tell you something off the record , Mister , ” he said . “ Those two were smarter than they knew . Their partnership was never legalized , it was never anything more than a piece of paper . And there 's a bunch of fellas around here mighty unhappy about that today . Jafe McCann is the one who handled all the money matters , like I said . He 's got IOU 's all over town. ” “ And they can n't collect from Karpin ? ” He nodded . “ Jafe McCann died just a bit too soon . He was sharp and cheap , but he was honest . If he 'd lived , he would have repaid all his debts , I 'm sure of it . And if this strike they made is as good as I hear , he would have been able to repay them with no trouble at all. ” I nodded , somewhat impatiently . I had the feeling by now that I was talking to a man who was one of those who had a Jafe McCann IOU in his pocket . “ How long has it been since you 've seen Karpin ? ” I asked him , wondering what Karpin 's attitude and expression was now that his partner was dead . “ Oh , Lord , not for a couple of months , ” he said . “ Not since they went out together the last time and made that strike. ” “ Did n't Karpin come in to make his claim ? ” “ Not here . Over to Chemisant City . That was the nearest M & R to the strike. ” “ Oh. ” That was a pity . I would have liked to have known if there had been a change of any kind in Karpin since his partner 's death . “ I 'll tell you what the situation is , ” I said , with a false air of truthfulness . “ We have some misgivings about McCann 's death . Not suspicions , exactly , just misgivings . The timing is what bothers us. ” “ You mean , because it happened just after the strike ? ” “ That 's it , ” I answered frankly . He shook his head . “ I would n't get too excited about that , if I were you , ” he said . “ It would n't be the first time it 's happened . A man makes the big strike after all , and he gets so excited he forgets himself for a minute and gets careless . And you only have to be careless once out here. ” “ That may be it , ” I said . I got to my feet , knowing I 'd picked up all there was from this man . “ Thanks a lot for your cooperation , ” I said . “ Any time , ” he said . He stood and shook hands with me . I went back out through the chatting prospectors and crossed the echoing cavern that was level one , aiming to rent myself a scooter . I do n't like rockets . They 're noisy as the dickens , they steer hard and drive erratically , and you can never carry what I would consider a safe emergency excess of fuel . Nothing like the big steady-g interplanetary liners . On those I feel almost human . The appearance of the scooter I was shown at the rental agency did n't do much to raise my opinion of this mode of transportation . The thing was a good ten years old , the paint scraped and scratched all over its egg-shaped , originally green-colored body , and the windshield — a silly term , really , for the front window of a craft that spends most of its time out where there is n't any wind — was scratched and pockmarked to the point of translucency by years of exposure to the asteroidal dust . The rental agent was a sharp-nosed thin-faced type who displayed this refugee from a melting vat without a blush , and still did n't blush when he told me the charges . Twenty credits a day , plus fuel . I paid without a murmur — it was the company 's money , not mine — and paid an additional ten credits for the rental of a suit to go with it . I worked my way awkwardly into the suit , and clambered into the driver 's seat of the relic . I attached the suit to the ship in all the necessary places , and the agent closed and spun the door . Most of the black paint had worn off the handles of the controls , and insulation peeked through rips in the plastic siding here and there . I wondered if the thing had any slow leaks and supposed fatalistically that it had . The agent waved at me , stony-faced , the conveyor belt trundled me outside the dome , and I kicked the weary rocket into life . The scooter had a tendency to roll to the right . If I had n't kept fighting it back , it would have soon worked up a dandy little spin . I was spending so much time juggling with the controls that I practically missed a couple of my beacon rocks , and that would have been just too bad . If I 'd gotten off the course I had carefully outlined for myself , I 'd never have found my bearings again , and I would have just floated around amid the scenery until some passerby took pity and towed me back home . But I managed to avoid getting lost , which surprised me , and after four nerve-wracking hours I finally spotted the yellow-painted X of a registered claim on a half-mile-thick chunk of rock dead ahead . As I got closer , I spied a scooter parked near the X , and beside it an inflated portable dome . The scooter was somewhat larger than mine , but no newer and probably even less safe . The dome was varicolored , from repeated patching . This would be the claim , and this is where I would find Karpin , sitting on his property while waiting for the sale to go through . Prospectors like Karpin are free-lance men , working for no particular company . They register their claims in their own names , and then sell the rights to whichever company shows up first with the most attractive offer . There 's a lot of paperwork to such a sale , and it 's all handled by the company . While waiting , the smart prospector sits on his claim and makes sure nobody chips off a part of it for himself , a stunt that still happens now and again . It does n't take too much concentrated explosive to make two rocks out of one rock , and a man 's claim is only the rock with his X on it . I set the scooter down next to the other one , and flicked the toggle for the air pumps , then put on the fishbowl and went about unattaching the suit from the ship . When the red light flashed on and off , I spun the door , opened it , and stepped out onto the rock , moving very cautiously . It is n't that I do n't believe the magnets in the boot soles will work , it 's just that I know for a fact that they wo n't work if I happen to raise both feet at the same time . Illustration I clumped across the crude X to Karpin 's dome . The dome had no viewports at all , so I was n't sure Karpin was aware of my presence . I rapped my metal glove on the metal outer door of the lock , and then I was sure . But it took him long enough to open up . I had just about decided he 'd joined his partner in the long sleep when the door cracked open an inch . I pushed it open and stepped into the lock , ducking my head . The door was only five feet high , and just as wide as the lock itself , three feet . The other dimensions of the lock were : height , six feet six ; width , one foot . Not exactly room to dance in . When the red light high on the left-hand wall clicked off , I rapped on the inner door . It promptly opened , I stepped through and removed the fishbowl . Karpin stood in the middle of the room , a small revolver in his hand . “ Shut the door , ” he said . I obeyed , moving slowly . I did n't want that gun to go off by mistake . “ Who are you ? ” Karpin demanded . The M & R man had been right . Ab Karpin was a dead ringer for all those other prospectors I 'd seen back at Atronics City . Short and skinny and grizzled and ageless . He could have been forty , and he could have been ninety , but he was probably somewhere the other side of fifty . His hair was black and limp and thinning , ruffled in little wisps across his wrinkled pate . His forehead and cheeks were lined like a plowed field , and were much the same color . His eyes were wide apart and small , so deep-set beneath shaggy brows that they seemed black . His mouth was thin , almost lipless . The hand holding the revolver was nothing but bones and blue veins covered with taut skin . He was wearing a dirty undershirt and an old pair of trousers that had been cut off raggedly just above his knobby knees . Faded slippers were on his feet . He had good reason for dressing that way , the temperature inside the dome must have been nearly ninety degrees . The dome was n't reflecting away the sun 's heat as well as it had when it was young . I looked at Karpin , and despite the revolver and the tense expression on his face , he was the least dangerous-looking man I 'd ever run across . All at once , the idea that this anti-social old geezer had the drive or the imagination to murder his partner seemed ridiculous . Apparently , I spent too much time looking him over , because he said again , “ Who are you ? ” And this time he motioned impatiently with the revolver . “ Stanton , ” I told him . “ Ged Stanton , Tangiers Mutual Insurance . I have identification , but it 's in my pants pocket , down inside this suit. ” “ Get it , ” he said . “ And move slow. ” “ Right you are. ” I moved slow , as per directions , and peeled out of the suit , then reached into my trouser pocket and took out my ID clip . I flipped it open and showed him the card bearing my signature and picture and right thumb-print and the name of the company I represented , and he nodded , satisfied , and tossed the revolver over onto his bed . “ I got to be careful , ” he said . “ I got a big claim here. ” “ I know that , ” I told him . “ Congratulations for it. ” “ Thanks , ” he said , but he still looked peevish . “ You 're here about Jafe 's insurance , right ? ” “ That I am. ” “ Do n't want to pay up , I suppose . That does n't surprise me. ” Blunt old men irritate me . “ Well , ” I said , “ we do have to investigate. ” “ Sure , ” he said . “ You want some coffee ? ” “ Thank you. ” “ You can sit in that chair there . That was Jafe 's. ” I settled gingerly in the cloth-and-plastic foldaway chair he 'd pointed at , and he went over to the kitchen area of the dome to start coffee . I took the opportunity to look the dome over . It was the first portable dome I 'd ever been inside . It was all one room , roughly circular , with a diameter of about fifteen feet . The sides went straight up for the first seven feet , then curved gradually inward to form the roof . At the center of the dome , the ceiling was about twelve feet high . The floor of the room was simply the asteroidal rock surface , not completely level and smooth . There were two chairs and a table to the right of the entry lock , two foldaway cots around the wall beyond them , the kitchen area next and a cluttered storage area around on the other side . There was a heater standing alone in the center of the room , but it certainly was n't needed now . Sweat was already trickling down the back of my neck and down my forehead into my eyebrows . I peeled off my shirt and used it to wipe sweat from my face . “ Warm in here , ” I said . “ You get used to it , ” he muttered , which I found hard to believe . He brought over the coffee , and I tasted it . It was rotten , as bitter as this old hermit 's soul , but I said , “ Good coffee . Thanks a lot. ” “ I like it strong , ” he said . I looked around at the room again . “ All the comforts of home , eh ? Pretty ingenious arrangement. ” “ Sure , ” he said sourly . “ How about getting to the point , Mister ? ” There 's only one way to handle a blunt old man . Be blunt right back . “ I 'll tell you how it is , ” I said . “ The company is n't accusing you of anything , but it has to be sure everything 's on the up and up before it pays out any ten thousand credits . And your partner just happening to fill out that cash-return form just before he died — well , you 've got to admit it is a funny kind of coincidence. ” “ How so ? ” He slurped coffee , and glowered at me over the cup . “ We made this strike here , ” he said . “ We knew it was the big one . Jafe had that insurance policy of his in case he never did make the big strike . As soon as we knew this was the big one , he said , ‘ I guess I do n't need that retirement now , ’ and sat right down and wrote out the cash-return . Then we opened a bottle of liquor and celebrated , and he got himself killed. ” The way Karpin said it , it sounded smooth and natural . Too smooth and natural . “ How did this accident happen anyway ? ” I asked him . “ I 'm not one hundred per cent sure of that myself , ” he said . “ I was pretty well drunk myself by that time . But he put on his suit and said he was going out to paint the X . He was falling all over himself , and I tried to tell him it could wait till we 'd had some sleep , but he would n't pay any attention to me. ” “ So he went out , ” I said . He nodded . “ He went out first . After a couple minutes , I got lonesome in here , so I suited up and went out after him . It happened just as I was going out the lock , and I just barely got a glimpse of what happened. ” He attacked the coffee again , noisily , and I prompted him , saying , “ What did happen , Mister Karpin ? ” “ Well , he was capering around out there , waving the paint tube and such . There 's a lot of sharp rock sticking out around here . Just as I got outside , he lost his balance and kicked out , and scraped right into some of that rock , and punctured his suit. ” “ I thought the body was lost , ” I said . He nodded . “ It was . The last thing in life Jafe ever did was try to shove himself away from those rocks . That , and the force of air coming out of that puncture for the first second or two , was enough to throw him up off the surface . It threw him up too high , and he never got back down. ” My doubt must have showed in my face , because he added , “ Mister , there is n't enough gravity on this place to shoot craps with. ” He was right . As we talked , I kept finding myself holding unnecessarily tight to the arms of the chair . I kept having the feeling I was going to float out of the chair and hover around up at the top of the dome if I were to let go . It was silly of course — there was some gravity on that planetoid , after all — but I just do n't seem to get used to low-gee . Nevertheless , I still had some more questions . “ Did n't you try to get his body back ? Could n't you have reached him ? ” “ I tried to , Mister , ” he said . “ Old Jafe McCann was my partner for fifteen years . But I was drunk , and that 's a fact . And I was afraid to go jumping up in the air , for fear I 'd go floating away , too. ” “ Frankly , ” I said , “ I 'm no expert on low gravity and asteroids . But would n't McCann 's body just go into orbit around this rock ? I mean , it would n't simply go floating off into space , would it ? ” “ It sure would , ” he said . “ There 's a lot of other rocks out here , too , Mister , and a lot of them are bigger than this one and have a lot more gravity pull . I do n't suppose there 's a navigator in the business who could have computed Jafe 's course in advance . He floated up , and then he floated back over the dome here and seemed to hover for a couple minutes , and then he just floated out and away . His is n't the only body circling around the sun with all these rocks , you know. ” I chewed a lip and thought it all over . I did n't know enough about asteroid gravity or the conditions out here to be able to say for sure whether Karpin 's story was true or not . Up to this point , I could n't attack the problem on a fact basis . I had to depend on feeling now , the hunches and instincts of eight years in this job , hearing some people tell lies and other people tell the truth . And my instinct said Ab Karpin was lying in his teeth . That dramatic little touch about McCann 's body hovering over the dome before disappearing into the void , that sounded more like the embellishment of fiction than the circumstance of truth . And the string of coincidences were just too much . McCann just coincidentally happens to die right after he and his partner make their big strike . He happens to write out the cash-return form just before dying . And his body just happens to float away , so nobody can look at it and check Karpin 's story . But no matter what my instinct said , the story was smooth . It was smooth as glass , and there was no place for me to get a grip on it . What now ? There was n't any hole in Karpin 's story , at least none that I could see . I had to break his story somehow , and in order to do that I had to do some nosing around on this planetoid . I could n't know in advance what I was looking for , I could only look . I 'd know it when I found it . It would be something that conflicted with Karpin 's story . And for that , I had to be sure the story was complete . “ You said McCann had gone out to paint the X , ” I said . “ Did he paint it ? ” Karpin shook his head . “ He never got a chance . He spent all his time dancing , up till he went and killed himself. ” “ So you painted it yourself. ” He nodded . “ And then you went on into Atronics City and registered your claim , is that the story ? ” “ No . Chemisant City was closer than Atronics City right then , so I went there . Just after Jafe 's death , and everything — I did n't feel like being alone any more than I had to. ” “ You said Chemisant City was closer to you then , ” I said . “ Is n't it now ? ” “ Things move around a lot out here , Mister , ” he said . “ Right now , Chemisant City 's almost twice as far from here as Atronics City . In about three days , it 'll start swinging in closer again . Things keep shifting around out here. ” “ So I 've noticed , ” I said . “ When you took off to go to Chemisant City , did n't you make a try for your partner 's body then ? ” He shook his head . “ He was long out of sight by then , ” he said . “ That was ten , eleven hours later , when I took off. ” “ Why 's that ? All you had to do was paint the X and take off. ” “ Mister , I told you . I was drunk . I was falling down drunk , and when I saw I could n't get at Jafe , and he was dead anyway , I came back in here and slept it off . Maybe if I 'd been sober I would have taken the scooter and gone after him , but I was drunk. ” “ I see. ” And there just were n't any more questions I could think of to ask , not right now . So I said , “ I 've just had a shaky four-hour ride coming out here . Mind if I stick around a while before going back ? ” “ Help yourself , ” he said , in a pretty poor attempt at genial hospitality . “ You can sleep over , if you want. ” “ Fine , ” I said . “ I think I 'd like that. ” “ You would n't happen to play cribbage , would you ? ” he asked , with the first real sign of animation I 'd seen in him yet . “ I learn fast , ” I told him . “ Okay , ” he said . “ I 'll teach you. ” And he produced a filthy deck of cards and taught me . After losing nine straight games of cribbage , I quit , and got to my feet . I was at my most casual as I stretched and said , “ Okay if I wander around outside for a while ? I 've never been on an asteroid like this before . I mean , a little one like this . I 've just been to the company cities up to now. ” “ Go right ahead , ” he said . “ I 've got some polishing and patching to do , anyway. ” He made his voice sound easy and innocent , but I noticed his eyes were alert and wary , watching me as I struggled back into my suit . I did n't bother to put my shirt back on first , and that was a mistake . The temperature inside an atmosphere suit is a steady sixty-eight degrees . That had never seemed particularly chilly before , but after the heat of that dome , it seemed cold as a blizzard inside the suit . I went on out through the airlock , and moved as briskly as possible in the cumbersome suit , while the sweat chilled on my back and face , and I accepted the glum conviction that one thing I was going to get out of this trip for sure was a nasty head cold . I went over to the X first , and stood looking at it . It was just an X , that 's all , shakily scrawled in yellow paint , with the initials “ J-A ” scrawled much smaller beside it . I left the X and clumped away . The horizon was practically at arm 's length , so it did n't take long for the dome to be out of sight . And then I clumped more slowly , studying the surface of the asteroid . What I was looking for was a grave . I believed that Karpin was lying , that he had murdered his partner . And I did n't believe that Jafe McCann 's body had floated off into space . I was convinced that his body was still somewhere on this asteroid . Karpin had been forced to concoct a story about the body being lost because the appearance of the body would prove somehow that it had been murder and not accident . I was convinced of that , and now all I had to do was prove it . But that asteroid was a pretty unlikely place for a grave . That was n't dirt I was walking on , it was rock , solid metallic rock . You do n't dig a grave in solid rock , not with a shovel . You maybe can do it with dynamite , but that wo n't work too well if your object is to keep anybody from seeing that the hole has been made . Dirt can be patted down . Blown-up rock looks like blown-up rock , and that 's all there is to it . I considered crevices and fissures in the surface , some cranny large enough for Karpin to have stuffed the body into . But I did n't find any of these either as I plodded along , being sure to keep one magnetted boot always in contact with the ground . Karpin and McCann had set their dome up at just about the only really level spot on that entire planetoid . The rest of it was nothing but jagged rock , and it was n't easy traveling at all , maneuvering around with magnets on my boots and a bulky atmosphere suit cramping my movements . And then I stopped and looked out at space and cursed myself for a ring-tailed baboon . McCann 's body might be anywhere in the Solar System , anywhere at all , but there was one place I could be sure it was n't , and that place was this asteroid . No , Karpin had not blown a grave or stuffed the body into a fissure in the ground . Why not ? Because this chunk of rock was valuable , that 's why not . Because Karpin was in the process of selling it to one of the major companies , and that company would come along and chop this chunk of rock to pieces , getting the valuable metal out , and McCann 's body would turn up in the first week of operations if Karpin were stupid enough to bury it here . Ten hours between McCann 's death and Karpin 's departure for Chemisant City . He 'd admitted that already . And I was willing to bet he 'd spent at least part of that time carrying McCann 's body to some other asteroid , one he was sure was nothing but worthless rock . If that were true , it meant the mortal remains of Jafe McCann were now somewhere — anywhere — in the Asteroid Belt . Even if I assumed that the body had been hidden on an asteroid somewhere between here and Chemisant City — which was n't necessarily so — that would n't help at all . The relative positions of planetoids in the Belt just keep on shifting . A small chunk of rock that was between here and Chemisant City a few weeks ago — it could be almost anywhere in the Belt right now . The body , that was the main item . I 'd more or less counted on finding it somehow . At the moment , I could n't think of any other angle for attacking Karpin 's story . As I clopped morosely back to the dome , I nibbled at Karpin 's story in my mind . For instance , why go to Chemisant City ? It was closer , he said , but it could n't have been closer by more than a couple of hours . The way I understood it , Karpin was well-known back on Atronics City — it was the normal base of operations for he and his partner — and he did n't know a soul at Chemisant City . Did it make sense for him to go somewhere he was n't known after his partner 's death , even if it was an hour closer ? No , it made a lot more sense for a man in that situation to go where he 's known , go someplace where he has friends who 'll sympathize with him and help him over the shock of losing a partner of fifteen years ’ standing , even if going there does mean traveling an hour longer . And there was always the cash-return form . That was what I was here about in the first place . It just did n't make sense for McCann to have held up his celebration while he filled out a form that he would n't be able to mail until he got back to Atronics City . And yet the company 's handwriting experts were convinced that it was n't a forgery , and I could pretty well take their word for it . Mulling these things over as I tramped back toward the dome , I suddenly heard a distant bell ringing way back in my head . The glimmering of an idea , not an idea yet but just the hint of one . I was n't sure where it led , or even if it led anywhere at all , but I was going to find out . Karpin opened the doors for me . By the time I 'd stripped off the suit he was back to work . He was cleaning the single unit which was his combination stove and refrigerator and sink and garbage disposal . I looked around the dome again , and I had to admit that a lot of ingenuity had gone into the manufacture and design of this dome and its contents . The dome itself , when deflated , folded down into an oblong box three feet by one foot by one foot . The lock itself , of course , folded separately , into another box somewhat smaller than that . As for the gear inside the dome , it was functional and collapsible , and there was n't a single item there that was n't needed . There were the two chairs and the two cots and the table , all of them foldaway . There was that fantastic combination job Karpin was cleaning right now , and that had dimensions of four feet by three feet by three feet . The clutter of gear over to the left was n't as much of a clutter as it looked . There was a Geiger counter , an automatic spectrograph , two atmosphere suits , a torsion densimeter , a core-cutting drill , a few small hammers and picks , two spare air tanks , boxes of food concentrate , a paint tube , a doorless jimmy-john and two small metal boxes about eight inches cube . These last were undoubtedly Karpin 's and McCann 's pouches , where they kept whatever letters , money , address books or other small bits of possessions they owned . Back of this mound of gear , against the wall , stood the air reconditioner , humming quietly to itself . In this small enclosed space there was everything a man needed to keep himself alive . Everything except human company . And if you did n't need human company , then you had everything . Just on the other side of that dome , there was a million miles of death , in a million possible ways . On this side of the dome , life was cozy , if somewhat Spartan and very hot . I knew for sure I was going to get a head cold . My body had adjusted to the sixty-eight degrees inside the suit , finally , and now was very annoyed to find the temperature shooting up to ninety again . Since Karpin did n't seem inclined to talk , and I would rather spend my time thinking than talking anyway , I took a hint from him and did some cleaning . I 'd noticed a smeared spot about nose-level on the faceplate of my fishbowl , and now was as good a time as any to get rid of it . It had a tendency to make my eyes cross . My shirt was sodden and wrinkled by this time anyway , having first been used to wipe sweat from my face and later been rolled into a ball and left on the chair when I went outside , so I used it for a cleaning rag , buffing like mad the silvered surface of the faceplate . Faceplates are silvered , not so the man inside can look out and no one else can look in , but in order to keep some of the more violent rays of the sun from getting through to the face . I buffed for a while , and then I put the fishbowl on my head and looked through it . The spot was gone , so I went over and reattached it to the rest of the suit , and then settled back in my chair again and lit a cigarette . Karpin spoke up . “ Wish you would n't smoke . Makes it tough on the conditioner. ” “ Oh , ” I said . “ Sorry. ” So I just sat , thinking morosely about non-forged cash-return forms , and coincidences , and likely spots to hide a body in the Asteroid Belt . Where would one dispose of a body in the asteroids ? I went back through my thinking on that topic , and I found holes big enough to drive Karpin 's claim through . This idea of leaving the body on some worthless chunk of rock , for instance . If Karpin had killed his partner — and I was dead sure he had — he 'd planned it carefully and he would n't be leaving anything to chance . Now , an asteroid is n't worthless to a prospector until that prospector has landed on it and tested it . Karpin might know that such-and-such an asteroid was nothing but worthless stone , but the guy who stops there and finds McCann 's body might not know it . No , Karpin would n't leave that to chance . He would get rid of that body , and he would do it in such a way that nobody would ever find it . How ? Not by leaving it on a worthless asteroid , and not by just pushing it off into space . The distance between asteroids is large , but so 's the travel . McCann 's body , floating around in the blackness , might just be found by somebody . And that , so far as I could see , eliminated the possibilities . McCann 's body was in the Belt . I 'd eliminated both the asteroids themselves and the space around the asteroids as hiding places . What was left ? The sun , of course . I thought that over for a while , rather surprised at myself for having noticed the possibility . Now , let 's say Karpin attaches a small rocket to McCann 's body , stuffed into its atmosphere suit . He sets the rocket going , and off goes McCann . Not that he aims it toward the sun , that would n't work well at all . Instead of falling into the sun , the body would simply take up a long elliptical orbit around the sun , and would come back to the asteroids every few hundred years . No , he would aim McCann back , in the direction opposite to the direction or rotation of the asteroids . He would , in essence , slow McCann 's body down , make it practically stop in relation to the motion of the asteroids . And then it would simply fall into the sun . None of my ideas , it seemed , were happy ones . If McCann 's body were even at this moment falling toward the sun , it was just as useful to me as if it were on some other asteroid . But , wait a second . Karpin and McCann had worked with the minimum of equipment , I 'd already noticed that . They did n't have extras of anything , and they certainly would n't have extra rockets . Except for one fast trip to Chemisant City — when he had neither the time nor the excuse to buy a jato rocket — Karpin had spent all of his time since McCann 's death right here on this planetoid . So that killed that idea . While I was hunting around for some other idea , Karpin spoke up again , for the first time in maybe twenty minutes . “ You think I killed him , do n't you ? ” he said , not looking around from his cleaning job . I considered my answer . There was no reason at all to be overly polite to this sour old buzzard , but at the same time I am naturally the soft-spoken type . “ We are n't sure , ” I said . “ We just think there are some odd items to be explained. ” “ Such as what ? ” he demanded . “ Such as the timing of McCann 's cash-return form. ” “ I already explained that , ” he said . “ I know . You 've explained everything. ” “ He wrote it out himself , ” the old man insisted . He put down his cleaning cloth , and turned to face me . “ I suppose your company checked the handwriting already , and Jafe McCann is the one who wrote that form. ” He was so blasted sure of himself . “ It would seem that way , ” I said . “ What other odd items you worried about ? ” he asked me , in a rusty attempt at sarcasm . “ Well , ” I said , “ there 's this business of going to Chemisant City . It would have made more sense for you to go to Atronics City , where you were known. ” “ Chemisant was closer , ” he said . He shook a finger at me . “ That company of yours thinks it can cheat me out of my money , ” he said . “ Well , it can n't . I know my rights . That money belongs to me. ” “ I guess you 're doing pretty well without McCann , ” I said . His angry expression was replaced by one of bewilderment . “ What do you mean ? ” “ They told me back at Atronics City , ” I explained , “ that McCann was the money expert and you were the metals expert , and that 's why McCann handled all your buying on credit and stuff like that . Looks as though you 've got a pretty keen eye for money yourself. ” “ I know what 's mine , ” he mumbled , and turned away . He went back to scrubbing the stove coils again . I stared at his back . Something had happened just then , and I was n't sure what . He 'd just been starting to warm up to a tirade against the dirty insurance company , and all of a sudden he 'd folded up and shut up like a clam . And then I saw it . Or at least I saw part of it . I saw how that cash-return form fit in , and how it made perfect sense . Now , all I needed was proof of murder . Preferably a body . I had the rest of it . Then I could pack the old geezer back to Atronics City and get proof for the part I 'd already figured out . I 'd like that . I 'd like getting back to Atronics City , and having this all straightened out , and then taking the very next liner straight back to Earth . More immediately , I 'd like getting out of this heat and back into the cool sixty-eight degrees of — And then it hit me . The whole thing hit me , and I just sat there and stared . They did not carry extras , Karpin and McCann , they did not carry one item of equipment more than they needed . I sat there and looked at the place where the dead body was hidden , and I said , “ Well , I 'll be a son of a gun ! ” He turned and looked at me , and then he followed the direction of my gaze , and he saw what I was staring at , and he made a jump across the room at the revolver lying on the cot . That 's what saved me . He moved too fast , jerked his muscles too hard , and went sailing up and over the cot and ricocheted off the dome wall . And that gave me plenty of time to get up from the chair , moving more cautiously than he had , and get my hands on the revolver before he could get himself squared away again . I straightened with the gun in my hand and looked into a face white with frustration and rage . “ Okay , Mister McCann , ” I said . “ It 's all over. ” He knew I had him , but he tried not to show it . “ What are you talking about ? McCann 's dead. ” “ Sure he is , ” I said . “ Jafe McCann was the money-minded part of the team . He was the one who signed for all the loans and all the equipment bought on credit . With this big strike in , Jafe McCann was the one who 'd have to pay all that money. ” “ You 're babbling , ” he snapped , but the words were hollow . “ You were n't satisfied with half a loaf , ” I said . “ You should have been . Half a loaf is better than none . But you wanted every penny you could get your hands on , and you wanted to pay out just as little money as you possibly could . So when you killed Ab Karpin , you saw a way to kill your debts as well . You 'd become Ab Karpin , and it would be Jafe McCann who was dead , and the debts dead with him. ” “ That 's a lie , ” he said , his voice getting shrill . “ I 'm Ab Karpin , and I 've got papers to prove it. ” “ Sure . Papers you stole from a dead man . And you might have gotten away with it , too . But you just could n't leave well enough alone , could you ? Not satisfied with having the whole claim to yourself , you switched identities with your victim to avoid your debts . And not satisfied with that , you filled out a cash-return form and tried to collect your money as your own heir . That 's why you had to go to Chemisant City , where nobody would recognize Ab Karpin or Jafe McCann , rather than to Atronics City where you were well-known. ” “ You do n't want to make too many wild accusations , ” he shouted , his voice shaking . “ You do n't want to go around accusing people of things you can n't prove. ” “ I can prove it , ” I told him . “ I can prove everything I 've said . As to who you are , there 's no problem . All I have to do is bring you back to Atronics City . There 'll be plenty of people there to identify you . And as to proving you murdered Ab Karpin , I think his body will be proof enough , do n't you ? ” McCann watched me as I backed slowly around the room to the mound of gear . The partners had had no extra equipment , no extra equipment at all . I looked down at the two atmosphere suits lying side by side on the metallic rock floor . Two atmosphere suits . The dead man was supposed to be in one of those , floating out in space somewhere . He was in the suit , right enough , I was sure of that , but he was n't floating anywhere . A space suit is a perfect place to hide a body , for as long as it has to be hid . The silvered faceplate keeps you from seeing inside , and the suit is , naturally , a sealed atmosphere . A body can rot away to ashes inside a space suit , and you 'll never notice a thing on the outside . I 'd had the right idea after all . McCann had planned to get rid of Karpin 's body by attaching a rocket to it , slowing it down , and letting it fall into the sun . But he had n't had an opportunity yet to go buy a rocket . He could n't go to Atronics City , where he could have bought the rocket on credit , and he could n't go to Chemisant City until the claim sale went through and he had some money to spend . And in the meantime , Karpin 's body was perfectly safe , sealed away inside his atmosphere suit . And it would have been safe , too , if McCann had n't been just a little bit too greedy . He could kill his partner and get away with it ; policemen on the Belt are even farther apart than the asteroids . He could swindle his creditors and get away with it ; they had no way of checking up and no reason to suspect a switch in identities . But when he tried to get his own money back from Tangiers Mutual Insurance ; that 's when he made his mistake . I studied the two atmosphere suits , at the same time managing to keep a wary eye on Jafe McCann , standing rigid and silent across the room . Which one of those suits contained the body of Ab Karpin ? The one with the new patch on the chest , of course . As I 'd guessed , McCann had shot him , and that 's why he had the problem of disposing of the body in the first place . I prodded that suit with my toe . “ He 's in there , is n't he ? ” “ You 're crazy. ” “ Think I should open it up and check ? It 's been almost a month , you know . I imagine he 's pretty ripe by now. ” I reached down to the neck-fastenings on the fishbowl , and McCann finally moved . His arms jerked up , and he cried , “ Do n't ! He 's in there , he 's in there ! For God 's sake , do n't open it up ! ” I relaxed . Mission accomplished . “ Crawl into your suit , little man , ” I said . “ We 've got ourselves a trip to make , the three of us. ” Henderson , as usual , was jovial but stern . “ You did a fine job up there , Ged , ” he said , with false familiarity . “ Really brilliant work. ” “ Thank you very much , ” I said . I was holding the last piece of news for a minute or two , relishing it . “ But you brought McCann in over a week ago . I do n't see why you had to stay up at Atronics City at all after that , much less ten days. ” I sat back in the chair and negligently crossed my legs . “ I just thought I 'd take a little vacation , ” I said carelessly , and lit a cigarette . I flicked ashes in the general direction of the ashtray on Henderson 's desk . Some of them made it . “ A vacation ? ” he echoed , eyes widening . Henderson was a company man , a real company man . A vacation for him was purgatory , it was separation from a loved one . “ I do n't believe you have a vacation coming , ” he said frostily , “ for at least six months. ” “ That 's what you think , Henny , ” I said . All he could do at that was blink . I went on , enjoying myself hugely . “ I do n't like this company , ” I said . “ And I do n't like this job . And I do n't like you . And from now on , I 've decided , it 's going to be vacation all the time. ” “ Ged , ” he said , his voice faint , “ what 's the matter with you ? Do n't you feel well ? ” “ I feel well , ” I told him . “ I feel fine . Now , I 'll tell you why I spent an extra ten days at Atronics City . McCann made and registered the big strike , right ? ” Henderson nodded blankly , apparently not trusting himself to speak . “ Wrong , ” I said cheerfully . “ McCann went to Chemisant City and filled out all the forms required for registering a claim . But every place he was supposed to sign his name he wrote Ab Karpin instead . Jafe McCann never did make a legal registration of his claim. ” Henderson just looked fish-eyed . “ So , ” I went on , “ as soon as I turned McCann over to the law at Atronics City , I went and registered that claim myself . And then I waited around for ten days until the company finished the paperwork involved in buying that claim from me . And then I came straight back here , just to say goodbye to you . Was n't that nice ? ” He did n't move . “ Goodbye , ” I said . THE END Illustration
