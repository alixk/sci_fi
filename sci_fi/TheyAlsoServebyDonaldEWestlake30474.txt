[ Illustration ] THEY ALSO SERVE By DONALD E. WESTLAKE Illustrated by Douglas Why should people hate vultures ? After all , a vulture never kills anyone ... The launch carrying the mail , supplies and replacements eased slowly in toward the base , keeping the bulk of the Moon between itself and Earth . Captain Ebor , seated at the controls , guided the ship to the rocky uneven ground with the easy carelessness of long practice , then cut the drive , got to his walking tentacles , and stretched . Donning his spacesuit , he left the ship to go over to the dome and meet Darquelnoy , the base commander . An open ground-car was waiting for him beside the ship . The driver , encased in his spacesuit , crossed tentacles in a sloppy salute , and Ebor returned the gesture quite as sloppily . Here on the periphery , cast formalities were all but dispensed with . Ebor stood for a moment and watched the unloading . The cargo crew , used to working in spacesuits , had one truck already half full . The replacements , unused to spacesuits and , in addition , awed and a bit startled by the bleakness of this satellite , were moving awkwardly down the ramp . Satisfied that the unloading was proceeding smoothly , Ebor climbed aboard the ground-car , awkward in his suit , and settled back heavily in the seat to try to get used to gravity again . The gravity of this Moon was slight , of course — barely one-sixth the gravity of the Home World or most of the colonies — but it still took getting used to , after a long trip in free-fall . The driver sat at the controls , and the car jerked into motion . Ebor , looking up , noticed for the first time that the dome was n't there any more . The main dome , housing the staff and equipment of the base , just was n't there . And the driver , he now saw , was aiming the car toward the nearby crater wall . Extending two of his eyes till they almost touched the face-plate of his helmet , he could see activity at the base of the crater wall , and what looked like an air-lock entrance . He wondered what had caused the change , which had obviously been done at top speed . The last time he 'd been here , not very long ago , the dome had still been intact , and there had been no hint of any impending move underground . The driver steered the car into the open air lock , and they waited until the first cargo truck had lumbered in after them . Then the outer door closed , the pumps were turned on , and in a minute the red light flashed over the inner door . Ebor removed the spacesuit gratefully , left it in the car , and walked clumsily through the inner door into the new base . A good job had been done on it , for all the speed . Rooms and corridors has been melted out of the rock , the floors had been carpeted , the walls painted , and the ceiling lined with light panels . All of the furnishings had been transferred here from the original dome , and the result looked , on the whole , quite livable . As livable as the dome had been , at least . But the base commander , Darquelnoy , waiting for his old friend Ebor near the inner door of the lock , looked anything but happy with the arrangement . At Ebor 's entrance he raised a limp tentacle in weary greeting and said , “ Come in , my friend , come in . Tell me the new jokes from home . I could use some cheering up. ” “ None worth telling , ” said Ebor . He looked around . “ What 's happened here ? ” he asked . “ Why 've you gone underground ? Why do you need cheering up ? ” Darquelnoy clicked his eyes in despair . “ Those things ! ” he cried . “ Those annoying little creatures on that blasted planet up there ! ” Ebor repressed an amused ripple . He knew Darquelnoy well enough to know that the commander invariably overstated things . “ What 've they been up to , Dar ? ” he asked . “ Come on , you can tell me over a hot cup of restno. ” “ I 've been practically living on the stuff for the last two dren , ” said Darquelnoy hopelessly . “ Well , I suppose another cup wo n't kill me . Come on to my quarters. ” “ I 've worked up a fine thirst on the trip , ” Ebor told him . The two walked down the long corridor together and Ebor said , “ Well ? What happened ? ” “ They came here , ” Darquelnoy told him simply . At Ebor 's shocked look , he rippled in wan amusement and said , “ Oh , it was n't as bad as it might have been , I suppose . It was just that we had to rush around so frantically , unloading and dismantling the dome , getting this place ready — ” “ What do you mean , they came here ? ” demanded Ebor . “ They are absolutely the worst creatures for secrecy in the entire galaxy ! ” exclaimed Darquelnoy in irritation . “ Absolutely the worst. ” “ Then you 've picked up at least one of their habits , ” Ebor told him . “ Now stop talking in circles and tell me what happened. ” “ They built a spaceship , is the long and the short of it , ” Darquelnoy answered . Ebor stopped in astonishment . “ No ! ” “ Do n't tell me no ! ” cried Darquelnoy . “ I saw it ! ” He was obviously at his wit 's end . “ It 's unbelievable , ” said Ebor . “ I know , ” said Darquelnoy . He led the way into his quarters , motioned Ebor to a perch , and rang for his orderly . “ It was just a little remote-controlled apparatus , of course , ” he said . “ The fledgling attempt , you know . But it circled this Moon here , busily taking pictures , and went right back to the planet again , giving us all a terrible fright . There had n't been the slightest indication they were planning anything that spectacular. ” “ None ? ” asked Ebor . “ Not a hint ? ” “ Oh , they 've been boasting about doing some such thing for ages , ” Darquelnoy told him . “ But there was never any indication that they were finally serious about it . They have all sorts of military secrecy , of course , and so you never know a thing is going to happen until it does. ” “ Did they get a picture of the dome ? ” “ Thankfully , no . And before they had a chance to try again , I whipped everything underground. ” “ It must have been hectic , ” Ebor said sympathetically . “ It was , ” said Darquelnoy simply . The orderly entered . Darquelnoy told him , “ Two restno , ” and he left again . “ I can n't imagine them making a spaceship , ” said Ebor thoughtfully . “ I would have thought they 'd have blown themselves up long before reaching that stage. ” “ I would have thought so , too , ” said Darquelnoy . “ But there it is . At the moment , they 've divided themselves into two camps — generally speaking , that is — and the two sides are trying like mad to outdo each other in everything . As a part of it , they 're shooting all sorts of rubbish into space and crowing every time a piece of the other side 's rubbish malfunctions. ” “ They could go on that way indefinitely , ” said Ebor . “ I know , ” said Darquelnoy gloomily . “ And here we sit. ” Ebor nodded , studying his friend . “ You do n't suppose this is all a waste of time , do you ? ” he asked , after a minute . Darquelnoy shook a tentacle in negation . “ Not at all , not at all . They 'll get around to it , sooner or later . They 're still boasting themselves into the proper frame of mind , that 's all. ” Ebor rippled in sympathetic amusement . “ I imagine you sometimes wish you could give them a little prodding in the right direction , ” he said . Darquelnoy fluttered his tentacles in horror , crying , “ Do n't even think of such a thing ! ” “ I know , I know , ” said Ebor hastily . “ The laws — ” “ Never mind the laws , ” snapped Darquelnoy . “ I 'm not even thinking about the laws . Frankly , if it would do any good , I might even consider breaking one or two of the laws , and the devil with my conditioning. ” “ You are upset , ” said Ebor at that . “ But if we were to interfere with those creatures up there , ” continued Darquelnoy , “ interfere with them in any way at all , it would be absolutely disastrous. ” The orderly returned at that point , with two steaming cups of restno . Darquelnoy and Ebor accepted the cups and the orderly left , making a sloppy tentacle-cross salute , which the two ignored . “ I was n't talking necessarily about attacking them , you know , ” said Ebor , returning to the subject . “ Neither was I , ” Darquelnoy told him . “ We would n't have to attack them . All we would have to do is let them know we 're here . Not even why we 're here , just the simple fact of our presence . That would be enough . They would attack us. ” Ebor extended his eyes in surprise . “ As vicious as all that ? ” “ Chilling , ” Darquelnoy told him . “ Absolutely chilling. ” “ Then I 'm surprised they have n't blown themselves to pieces long before this. ” “ Oh , well , ” said Darquelnoy , “ you see , they 're cowards , too . They have to boast and brag and shout a while before they finally get to clawing and biting at one another. ” Ebor waved a tentacle . “ Do n't make it so vivid. ” “ Sorry , ” apologized Darquelnoy . He drained his cup of restno . “ Out here , ” he said , “ living next door to the little beasts day after day , one begins to lose one 's sensibilities. ” “ It has been a long time , ” agreed Ebor . “ Longer than we had originally anticipated , ” Darquelnoy said frankly . “ We 've been ready to move in for I do n't know how long . And instead we just sit here and wait . Which is n't good for morale , either. ” “ No , I do n't imagine it is. ” “ There 's already a theory among some of the workmen that the blow-up just is n't going to happen , ever . And since that ship went circling by , of course , morale has hit a new low. ” “ It would have been nasty if they 'd spotted you , ” said Ebor . “ Nasty ? ” echoed Darquelnoy . “ Catastrophic , you mean . All that crowd up there needs is an enemy , and it does n't much matter to them who that enemy is . If they were to suspect that we were here , they 'd forget their own little squabbles at once and start killing us instead . And that , of course , would mean that they 'd be united , for the first time in their history , and who knows how long it would take them before they 'd get back to killing one another again. ” “ Well , ” said Ebor , “ you 're underground now . And it can n't possibly take them too much longer. ” “ One would n't think so , ” agreed Darquelnoy . “ In a way , ” he added , “ that spaceship was a hopeful sign . It means that they 'll be sending a manned ship along pretty soon , and that should do the trick . As soon as one side has a base on the Moon , the other side is bound to get things started. ” “ A relief for you , eh ? ” said Ebor . “ You know , ” said Darquelnoy thoughtfully , “ I can n't help thinking I was born in the wrong age . All this scrabbling around , searching everywhere for suitable planets . Back when the Universe was younger , there were lots and lots of planets to colonize . Now the old problem of half-life is taking its toll , and we can n't even hope to keep up with the birth rate any more . If it were n't for the occasional planets like that one up there , I do n't know what we 'd do. ” “ Do n't worry , ” Ebor told him . “ They 'll have their atomic war pretty soon , and leave us a nice high-radiation planet to colonize. ” “ I certainly hope it 's soon , ” said Darquelnoy . “ This waiting gets on one 's nerves. ” He rang for the orderly .
