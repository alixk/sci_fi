THE HATED By PAUL FLEHR After space , there was always one more river to cross ... the far side of hatred and murder ! Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS The bar did n't have a name . No name of any kind . Not even an indication that it had ever had one . All it said on the outside was : Cafe EAT Cocktails which does n't make a lot of sense . But it was a bar . It had a big TV set going ya-ta-ta ya-ta-ta in three glorious colors , and a jukebox that tried to drown out the TV with that lousy music they play . Anyway , it was n't a kid hangout . I kind of like it . But I was n't supposed to be there at all ; it 's in the contract . I was supposed to stay in New York and the New England states . Cafe-EAT-Cocktails was right across the river . I think the name of the place was Hoboken , but I 'm not sure . It all had a kind of dreamy feeling to it . I was — Well , I could n't even remember going there . I remembered one minute I was downtown New York , looking across the river . I did that a lot . And then I was there . I do n't remember crossing the river at all . I was drunk , you know . You know how it is ? Double bourbons and keep them coming . And after a while the bartender stops bringing me the ginger ale because gradually I forget to mix them . I got pretty loaded long before I left New York . I realize that . I guess I had to get pretty loaded to risk the pension and all . Used to be I did n't drink much , but now , I do n't know , when I have one drink , I get to thinking about Sam and Wally and Chowderhead and Gilvey and the captain . If I do n't drink , I think about them , too , and then I take a drink . And that leads to another drink , and it all comes out to the same thing . Well , I guess I said it already , I drink a pretty good amount , but you can n't blame me . There was a girl . I always get a girl someplace . Usually they are n't much and this one was n't either . I mean she was probably somebody 's mother . She was around thirty-five and not so bad , though she had a long scar under her ear down along her throat to the little round spot where her larynx was . It was n't ugly . She smelled nice — while I could still smell , you know — and she did n't talk much . I liked that . Only — Well , did you ever meet somebody with a nervous cough ? Like when you say something funny — a little funny , not a big yock — they do n't laugh and they do n't stop with just smiling , but they sort of cough ? She did that . I began to itch . I could n't help it . I asked her to stop it . She spilled her drink and looked at me almost as though she was scared — and I had tried to say it quietly , too . “ Sorry , ” she said , a little angry , a little scared . “ Sorry . But you do n't have to — ” “ Forget it. ” “ Sure . But you asked me to sit down here with you , remember ? If you 're going to — ” “ Forget it ! ” I nodded at the bartender and held up two fingers . “ You need another drink , ” I said . “ The thing is , ” I said , “ Gilvey used to do that. ” “ What ? ” “ That cough. ” She looked puzzled . “ You mean like this ? ” “ Goddam it , stop it ! ” Even the bartender looked over at me that time . Now she was really mad , but I did n't want her to go away . I said , “ Gilvey was a fellow who went to Mars with me . Pat Gilvey. ” “ Oh. ” She sat down again and leaned across the table , low . “ Mars. ” The bartender brought our drinks and looked at me suspiciously . I said , “ Say , Mac , would you turn down the air-conditioning ? ” “ My name is n't Mac . No. ” “ Have a heart . It 's too cold in here. ” “ Sorry. ” He did n't sound sorry . I was cold . I mean that kind of weather , it 's always cold in those places . You know around New York in August ? It hits eighty , eighty-five , ninety . All the places have air-conditioning and what they really want is for you to wear a shirt and tie . But I like to walk a lot . You would , too , you know . And you can n't walk around much in long pants and a suit coat and all that stuff . Not around there . Not in August . And so then , when I went into a bar , it 'd have one of those built-in freezers for the used-car salesmen with their dates , or maybe their wives , all dressed up . For what ? But I froze . “ Mars , ” the girl breathed . “ Mars. ” I began to itch again . “ Want to dance ? ” “ They do n't have a license , ” she said . “ Byron , I did n't know you 'd been to Mars ! Please tell me about it. ” “ It was all right , ” I said . That was a lie . She was interested . She forgot to smile . It made her look nicer . She said , “ I knew a man — my brother-in-law — he was my husband 's brother — I mean my ex-husband — ” “ I get the idea. ” “ He worked for General Atomic . In Rockford , Illinois . You know where that is ? ” “ Sure. ” I could n't go there , but I knew where Illinois was . “ He worked on the first Mars ship . Oh , fifteen years ago , was n't it ? He always wanted to go himself , but he could n't pass the tests. ” She stopped and looked at me . I knew what she was thinking . But I did n't always look this way , you know . Not that there 's anything wrong with me now , I mean , but I could n't pass the tests any more . Nobody can . That 's why we 're all one-trippers . I said , “ The only reason I 'm shaking like this is because I 'm cold. ” It was n't true , of course . It was that cough of Gilvey 's . I did n't like to think about Gilvey , or Sam or Chowderhead or Wally or the captain . I did n't like to think about any of them . It made me shake . You see , we could n't kill each other . They would n't let us do that . Before we took off , they did something to our minds to make sure . What they did , it does n't last forever . It lasts for two years and then it wears off . That 's long enough , you see , because that gets you to Mars and back ; and it 's plenty long enough , in another way , because it 's like a strait-jacket . You know how to make a baby cry ? Hold his hands . It 's the most basic thing there is . What they did to us so we could n't kill each other , it was like being tied up , like having our hands held so we could n't get free . Well . But two years was long enough . Too long . The bartender came over and said , “ Pal , I 'm sorry . See , I turned the air-conditioning down . You all right ? You look so — ” I said , “ Sure , I 'm all right. ” He sounded worried . I had n't even heard him come back . The girl was looking worried , too , I guess because I was shaking so hard I was spilling my drink . I put some money on the table without even counting it . “ It 's all right , ” I said . “ We were just going. ” “ We were ? ” She looked confused . But she came along with me . They always do , once they find out you 've been to Mars . In the next place , she said , between trips to the powder room , “ It must take a lot of courage to sign up for something like that . Were you scientifically inclined in school ? Do n't you have to know an awful lot to be a space-flyer ? Did you ever see any of those little monkey characters they say live on Mars ? I read an article about how they lived in little cities of pup-tents or something like that — only they did n't make them , they grew them . Funny ! Ever see those ? That trip must have been a real drag , I bet . What is it , nine months ? You could n't have a baby ! Excuse me — Say , tell me . All that time , how 'd you — well , manage things ? I mean did n't you ever have to go to the you-know or anything ? ” “ We managed , ” I said . She giggled , and that reminded her , so she went to the powder room again . I thought about getting up and leaving while she was gone , but what was the use of that ? I 'd only pick up somebody else . It was nearly midnight . A couple of minutes would n't hurt . I reached in my pocket for the little box of pills they give us — it is n't refillable , but we get a new prescription in the mail every month , along with the pension check . The label on the box said : CAUTION Use only as directed by physician . Not to be taken by persons suffering heart condition , digestive upset or circulatory disease . Not to be used in conjunction with alcoholic beverages . I took three of them . I do n't like to start them before midnight , but anyway I stopped shaking . I closed my eyes , and then I was on the ship again . The noise in the bar became the noise of the rockets and the air washers and the sludge sluicers . I began to sweat , although this place was air-conditioned , too . I could hear Wally whistling to himself the way he did , the sound muffled by his oxygen mask and drowned in the rocket noise , but still perfectly audible . The tune was Sophisticated Lady . Sometimes it was Easy to Love and sometimes Chasing Shadows , but mostly Sophisticated Lady . He was from Juilliard . Somebody sneezed , and it sounded just like Chowderhead sneezing . You know how everybody sneezes according to his own individual style ? Chowderhead had a ladylike little sneeze ; it went hutta , real quick , all through the mouth , no nose involved . The captain went Hrasssh ; Wally was Ashoo , ashoo , ashoo . Gilvey was Hutch-uh . Sam did n't sneeze much , but he sort of coughed and sprayed , and that was worse . Sometimes I used to think about killing Sam by tying him down and having Wally and the captain sneeze him to death . But that was a kind of a joke , naturally , when I was feeling good . Or pretty good . Usually I thought about a knife for Sam . For Chowderhead it was a gun , right in the belly , one shot . For Wally it was a tommy gun — just stitching him up and down , you know , back and forth . The captain I would put in a cage with hungry lions , and Gilvey I 'd strangle with my bare hands . That was probably because of the cough , I guess . She was back . “ Please tell me about it , ” she begged . “ I 'm so curious. ” I opened my eyes . “ You want me to tell you about it ? ” “ Oh , please ! ” “ About what it 's like to fly to Mars on a rocket ? ” “ Yes ! ” “ All right , ” I said . It 's wonderful what three little white pills will do . I was n't even shaking . “ There 's six men , see ? In a space the size of a Buick , and that 's all the room there is . Two of us in the bunks all the time , four of us on watch . Maybe you want to stay in the sack an extra ten minutes — because it 's the only place on the ship where you can stretch out , you know , the only place where you can rest without somebody 's elbow in your side . But you can n't . Because by then it 's the next man 's turn . “ And maybe you do n't have elbows in your side while it 's your turn off watch , but in the starboard bunk there 's the air-regenerator master valve — I bet I could still show you the bruises right around my kidneys — and in the port bunk there 's the emergency-escape-hatch handle . That gets you right in the temple , if you turn your head too fast . “ And you can n't really sleep , I mean not soundly , because of the noise . That is , when the rockets are going . When they are n't going , then you 're in free-fall , and that 's bad , too , because you dream about falling . But when they 're going , I do n't know , I think it 's worse . It 's pretty loud . “ And even if it were n't for the noise , if you sleep too soundly you might roll over on your oxygen line . Then you dream about drowning . Ever do that ? You 're strangling and choking and you can n't get any air ? It is n't dangerous , I guess . Anyway , it always woke me up in time . Though I heard about a fellow in a flight six years ago — “ Well . So you 've always got this oxygen mask on , all the time , except if you take it off for a second to talk to somebody . You do n't do that very often , because what is there to say ? Oh , maybe the first couple of weeks , sure — everybody 's friends then . You do n't even need the mask , for that matter . Or not very much . Everybody 's still pretty clean . The place smells — oh , let 's see — about like the locker room in a gym . You know ? You can stand it . That 's if nobody 's got space sickness , of course . We were lucky that way . “ But that 's about how it 's going to get anyway , you know . Outside the masks , it 's soup . It is n't that you smell it so much . You kind of taste it , in the back of your mouth , and your eyes sting . That 's after the first two or three months . Later on , it gets worse . “ And with the mask on , of course , the oxygen mixture is coming in under pressure . That 's funny if you 're not used to it . Your lungs have to work a little bit harder to get rid of it , especially when you 're asleep , so after a while the muscles get sore . And then they get sorer . And then — “ Well . “ Before we take off , the psych people give us a long doo-da that keeps us from killing each other . But they can n't stop us from thinking about it . And afterward , after we 're back on Earth — this is what you wo n't read about in the articles — they keep us apart . You know how they work it ? We get a pension , naturally . I mean there 's got to be a pension , otherwise there is n't enough money in the world to make anybody go . But in the contract , it says to get the pension we have to stay in our own area . Illustration “ The whole country 's marked off . Six sections . Each has at least one big city in it . I was lucky , I got a lot of them . They try to keep it so every man 's home town is in his own section , but — well , like with us , Chowderhead and the captain both happened to come from Santa Monica . I think it was Chowderhead that got California , Nevada , all that Southwest area . It was the luck of the draw God knows what the captain got . “ Maybe New Jersey , ” I said , and took another white pill . We went on to another place and she said suddenly , “ I figured something out . The way you keep looking around. ” “ What did you figure out ? ” “ Well , part of it was what you said about the other fellow getting New Jersey . This is New Jersey . You do n't belong in this section , right ? ” “ Right , ” I said after a minute . “ So why are you here ? I know why . You 're here because you 're looking for somebody. ” “ That 's right. ” She said triumphantly , “ You want to find that other fellow from your crew ! You want to fight him ! ” I could n't help shaking , white pills or no white pills . But I had to correct her . “ No . I want to kill him. ” “ How do you know he 's here ? He 's got a lot of states to roam around in , too , does n't he ? ” “ Six . New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Delaware , Maryland — all the way down to Washington. ” “ Then how do you know — ” “ He 'll be here. ” I did n't have to tell her how I knew . But I knew . I was n't the only one who spent his time at the border of his assigned area , looking across the river or staring across a state line , knowing that somebody was on the other side . I knew . You fight a war and you do n't have to guess that the enemy might have his troops a thousand miles away from the battle line . You know where his troops will be . You know he wants to fight , too . Hutta . Hutta . I spilled my drink . I looked at her . “ You — you did n't — ” She looked frightened . “ What 's the matter ? ” “ Did you just sneeze ? ” “ Sneeze ? Me ? Did I — ” I said something quick and nasty , I do n't know what . No ! It had n't been her . I knew it . It was Chowderhead 's sneeze . Chowderhead . Marvin T. Roebuck , his name was . Five feet eight inches tall . Dark-complected , with a cast in one eye . Spoke with a Midwest kind of accent , even though he came from California —" shrick ” for “ shriek , ” “ hawror ” for “ horror , ” like that . It drove me crazy after a while . Maybe that gives you an idea what he talked about mostly . A skunk . A thoroughgoing , deep-rooted , mother-murdering skunk . I kicked over my chair and roared , “ Roebuck ! Where are you , damn you ? ” The bar was all at once silent . Only the jukebox kept going . “ I know you 're here ! ” I screamed . “ Come out and get it ! You louse , I told you I 'd get you for calling me a liar the day Wally sneaked a smoke ! ” Silence , everybody looking at me . Then the door of the men 's room opened . He came out . He looked lousy . Eyes all red-rimmed and his hair falling out — the poor crumb could n't have been over twenty-nine . He shrieked , “ You ! ” He called me a million names . He said , “ You thieving rat , I 'll teach you to try to cheat me out of my candy ration ! ” He had a knife . I did n't care . I did n't have anything and that was stupid , but it did n't matter . I got a bottle of beer from the next table and smashed it against the back of a chair . It made a good weapon , you know ; I 'd take that against a knife any time . I ran toward him , and he came all staggering and lurching toward me , looking crazy and desperate , mumbling and raving — I could hardly hear him , because I was talking , too . Nobody tried to stop us . Somebody went out the door and I figured it was to call the cops , but that was all right . Once I took care of Chowderhead , I did n't care what the cops did . I went for the face . He cut me first . I felt the knife slide up along my left arm but , you know , it did n't even hurt , only kind of stung a little . I did n't care about that . I got him in the face , and the bottle came away , and it was all like gray and white jelly , and then blood began to spring out . He screamed . Oh , that scream ! I never heard anything like that scream . It was what I had been waiting all my life for . I kicked him as he staggered back , and he fell . And I was on top of him , with the bottle , and I was careful to stay away from the heart or the throat , because that was too quick , but I worked over the face , and I felt his knife get me a couple times more , and — And — And I woke up , you know . And there was Dr. Santly over me with a hypodermic needle that he 'd just taken out of my arm , and four male nurses in fatigues holding me down . And I was drenched with sweat . For a minute , I did n't know where I was . It was a horrible queasy falling sensation , as though the bar and the fight and the world were all dissolving into smoke around me . Then I knew where I was . It was almost worse . I stopped yelling and just lay there , looking up at them . Dr. Santly said , trying to keep his face friendly and noncommittal , “ You 're doing much better , Byron , boy . Much better. ” I did n't say anything . He said , “ You worked through the whole thing in two hours and eight minutes . Remember the first time ? You were sixteen hours killing him . Captain Van Wyck it was that time , remember ? Who was it this time ? ” “ Chowderhead. ” I looked at the male nurses . Doubtfully , they let go of my arms and legs . “ Chowderhead , ” said Dr. Santly . “ Oh — Roebuck . That boy , ” he said mournfully , his expression saddened , “ he 's not coming along nearly as well as you . Nearly . He can n't run through a cycle in less than five hours . And , that 's peculiar , it 's usually you he — Well , I better not say that , shall I ? No sense setting up a counter-impression when your pores are all open , so to speak ? ” He smiled at me , but he was a little worried in back of the smile . I sat up . “ Anybody got a cigarette ? ” “ Give him a cigarette , Johnson , ” the doctor ordered the male nurse standing alongside my right foot . Johnson did . I fired up . “ You 're coming along splendidly , ” Dr. Santly said . He was one of these psych guys that thinks if you say it 's so , it makes it so . You know that kind ? “ We 'll have you down under an hour before the end of the week . That 's marvelous progress . Then we can work on the conscious level ! You 're doing extremely well , whether you know it or not . Why , in six months — say in eight months , because I like to be conservative — ” he twinkled at me —" we 'll have you out of here ! You 'll be the first of your crew to be discharged , you know that ? ” “ That 's nice , ” I said . “ The others are n't doing so well ? ” “ No . Not at all well , most of them . Particularly Dr. Gilvey . The run-throughs leave him in terrible shape . I do n't mind admitting I 'm worried about him. ” “ That 's nice , ” I said , and this time I meant it . He looked at me thoughtfully , but all he did was say to the male nurses , “ He 's all right now . Help him off the table. ” It was hard standing up . I had to hold onto the rail around the table for a minute . I said my set little speech : “ Dr. Santly , I want to tell you again how grateful I am for this . I was reconciled to living the rest of my life confined to one part of the country , the way the other crews always did . But this is much better . I appreciate it . I 'm sure the others do , too. ” “ Of course , boy . Of course. ” He took out a fountain pen and made a note on my chart ; I could n't see what it was , but he looked gratified . “ It 's no more than you have coming to you , Byron , ” he said . “ I 'm grateful that I could be the one to make it come to pass. ” He glanced conspiratorially at the male nurses . “ You know how important this is to me . It 's the triumph of a whole new approach to psychic rehabilitation . I mean to say our heroes of space travel are entitled to freedom when they come back home to Earth , are n't they ? ” “ Definitely , ” I said , scrubbing some of the sweat off my face onto my sleeve . “ So we 've got to end this system of designated areas . We can n't avoid the tensions that accompany space travel , no . But if we can help you eliminate harmful tensions with a few run-throughs , why , it 's not too high a price to pay , is it ? ” “ Not a bit. ” “ I mean to say , ” he said , warming up , “ you can look forward to the time when you 'll be able to mingle with your old friends from the rocket , free and easy , without any need for restraint . That 's a lot to look forward to , is n't it ? ” “ It is , ” I said . “ I look forward to it very much , ” I said . “ And I know exactly what I 'm going to do the first time I meet one — I mean without any restraints , as you say , ” I said . And it was true ; I did . Only it would n't be a broken beer bottle that I would do it with . I had much more elaborate ideas than that . — PAUL FLEHR
