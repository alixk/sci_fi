[ Illustration ] MASTER OF NONE BY NEIL GOBLE The advantages of specialization are so obvious that , today , we do n't even know how to recognize a competent syncretist ! Freddy the Fish glanced at the folded newspaper beside him on the bench . A little one-column headline caught his eye : MYSTERIOUS SIGNALS FROM OUTER SPACE “ Probably from Cygnus , ” he said . Freddy mashed a peanut , popped the meat into his mouth , and tossed the shell to the curb in front of his bench . He munched and idly watched two sparrows arguing over the discarded delicacy ; the victor flitted to the head of a statue , let go a triumphant dropping onto the marble nose , and hopped to a nearby branch . “ Serves him right , ” Freddy said . He yawned and rubbed the stubble on his chin . Not yet long enough for scissors , he decided . He pulled his feet up on the bench , twisting in an effort to get comfortable . The sun was in his eyes , so he reclaimed the discarded newspaper and spread it over his face . His eyes momentarily focused on MYSTERIOUS SIGNALS FROM OUTER SPACE , right over his nose . “ Sure , Cygnus , ” he muttered , and closed his eyes and dropped off to sleep . When he was awakened , it was by an excited hand shaking his shoulder and a panting , “ Freddy ! Freddy ! Lookit the Extra just came out ! ” Freddy slowly sat up , ascertained the identity of the intruder and the fact that the sun was setting , and said , “ Good evening , Willy . Please stop rattling that paper in my face. ” “ But just read it , Freddy , ” Willy shrieked , waving the paper so frantically that Freddy could n't make out the big black headline . “ ' Positive contact from another planet , ’ the guy was yellin '. They put out an Extra so I snitched one from the boy . Read it to me , huh , Freddy ? I 'm dyin ’ o ’ curious. ” “ So give it here and I 'll read it for you . Quit shakin ’ it or you 'll tear it all up , ” Freddy snorted . “ Read it to me , huh , Freddy , ” Willy said , handing over the paper . “ I do n't know no one else that reads so good. ” Freddy studied the headline and the first paragraph silently , then whistled lightly and lowered the paper . “ Y ' know , Willy , ” he said , “ the last thing I read before I dropped off a while ago was about these signals . But the funny thing is , I 'd just assumed they were from Cygnus. ” “ What 's a Cygnus , Freddy ? ” Willy asked , still pop-eyed . “ A smoke ? A dame ? Or you mean like from Hunger ? ” “ Cygnus , my boy , ” Freddy explained patronizingly , “ is a constellation within which there are two colliding galaxies . These colliding galaxies produce the most powerful electromagnetic radiations in the universe — an undecillion watts ! ” “ What 's an undecillion ? ” “ An undecillion is ten raised to the 36th power , ” Freddy sighed , fearing that he was n't getting through to Willy . “ No foolin '? What 's a watt ... aw , you 're pullin ’ my leg again , Freddy , talkin ’ riddles . Where 'd ya ever learn to talk that way anyhow ! ” “ Harvard , Yale , Princeton , Oxford , Georgia Tech , Oklahoma . Picked up a little here , a little there , ” Freddy said , reflecting on his indiscriminate past . “ Aw , cut it out , Freddy ! C ' mon , read it to me . Betcha can n't ! Where 'd ya say it was from ? Cygnus ? ” “ Not Cygnus . Ganymede. ” Freddy cleared his throat and rattled the newspaper authoritatively . “ Washington : White House sources declared today that intelligent beings on a Jupiter moon have contacted the United States government . While the contents of the message have been made secret , the White House emphasized the message was friendly. ” Freddy continued , “ The signals , which were intercepted yesterday , were decoded this morning by a team of government scientists and cryptographers who had been at the task all night . While officials were noncommittal about the nature of the message contained in the signals , they declared , ‘ We are authorized to state that the received message was friendly and appears to represent a sincere attempt by another race of intelligent beings to contact the people of Earth . A reply message is being formulated. ’ Officials further explained that the possibility of the signal 's being a hoax has been thoroughly investigated and that there is no doubt whatsoever that the message is a genuine interspatial communication from intelligent beings on Ganymede . Ganymede is one of twelve moons of the planet Jupiter , and is larger than the planet Mercury. ” Freddy stopped . “ Ai n't there any more ? ” Willy whined . “ The rest of it is about how far away Ganymede is , and its relative density and mass and stuff . You would n't be interested , Willy. ” “ Oh . I guess not. ” Willy helped himself to a peanut . “ What 's it mean , Freddy ? ” “ Nothing much , Willy . Just that there 's people somewhere besides here on Earth , and they called us on the phone. ” “ Whadd ' ya know about that ! ” Willy gasped . “ I did n't even know they was other people ! ” He stared with disbelief at the paper . “ I do n't suppose anyone knew. ” “ How d ' ya suppose they knew ? ” Willy asked . “ I mean , that we was here , if we did n't know they was there ? ” “ I 've been wondering about that , Willy . You know that last rocket we shot ? ” “ From Cape Carnival you mean ? ” “ Yeh . It was supposed to go into orbit around Jupiter . I would n't be surprised if maybe it did n't land on Ganymede ; the people there could have examined it , figured out where it came from , and then radioed us on the same frequency the rocket transmitter used . Paper does n't say that , of course , but it 's a reasonable hypothesis. ” “ Freddy , I think you must be a genius or sumpin '. ” Freddy smiled and stretched out to sleep again as Willy wandered off , staring blankly at the newspaper . Carlton Jones , America 's Number One personnel specialist , scowled at the pamphlet on his desk . SECRET , it said in big red letters across the top and bottom . Special Instructions for Operation Space Case , said the smaller letters across the middle of the top sheet . “ Now I ask you , Dwindle , ” Jones said to his clerkish aide , “ where , in this worldful of specialists , am I going to find someone with a well-rounded education ? Much less one who 'll take a chance on a flier like this ? ” “ Gosh , Mr. Jones , I just would n't know , ” Dwindle blinked . “ Have you tried looking through your files ? ” “ Have I tried looking through my files , ” Jones sighed , looking at the ceiling light . “ Dwindle , my files include every gainfully employed person in the United States of America and its possessions . Millions of them . One does n't just browse through the files looking for things. ” “ Oh , ” Dwindle said . “ I 'm kinda new at this specialty , ” he explained . “ Yes , Dwindle . However , ” Jones continued , “ one does make IBM runouts to find things. ” “ Hey , that 's great ! ” Dwindle said , brightening . “ Why do n't you try making an IBM runout ? ” “ I did , Dwindle . Please let me finish ? Our instructions call for finding a person with a well-rounded education . More specifically , a person who is capable of intelligently discussing and explaining some two dozen major ‘ fields of knowledge. ’ Plus , of course , at least a passing acquaintance with some one or two hundred minor fields of knowledge . “ So I set Mathematics into the IBM sorter . Mathematics is one of the major fields of knowledge , you see. ” “ Yeh , ” Dwindle acknowledged . “ So I took the few million mathematicians ’ cards which I got — good mathematicians and bad mathematicians , but at least people who can get their decimals in the right place . I set the IBM sorter for Biology , and ran the mathematicians ’ cards through . So I got several thousand mathematician-biologists. ” “ That 's pretty sharp ! ” Dwindle exclaimed with a twinkle . “ Whoever thought of that ! ” “ Please , Dwindle , ” Jones moaned , pressing his palms to his eyes . “ Next I sorted according to Geology . Three hundred cards came through . Three hundred people in America who know their math , biology and geology ! ” “ That does n't sound like so many to me , ” Dwindle said hesitantly , as if wondering what there was to get so excited about . “ And of those three hundred , do you know how many understand , even vaguely , Electronics ? Twelve . And of those twelve , guess how many have an adequate background in History and Anthropology ? Much less an understanding of eighteen other fields ? ” “ Not very many , I 'll bet , ” Dwindle replied smartly . “ None ! Not even one ! I tried running the cards through in every order imaginable . We 've bred a race of specialists and there 's not a truly educated man among us ! ” “ Say , you know what I bet ? Even if you did find a guy who 's like what all you said ... ” “ Go ahead , Dwindle. ” “ ... I bet he would n't even go up there to Ganymede . I sure would n't ! I 'd be scared to death , ” Dwindle chattered , waving his finger . “ How 's he gonna get back , even if he gets there O. K .? Could n't anyone fool me with a bunch of pretty talk ; I know the government does n't have a rocket that could take off again after it got there . Gotta have launching pads and computers and all that stuff . Government ever think about that ? ” Jones held his head in anguish . “ Dwindle , why do n't you be a good boy and run along to the snack bar for a coffee break ? And bring me some aspirin when you come back. ” Freddy the Fish , Willy and Oscar Fronk were occupying the same bench , a comradeship made necessary by the overpopulation of the park on such a glorious day . Oscar was surveying the passing girls and scouting for worthwhile cigarette stubs . Willy was admiring a hovering beetle 's power of flight , and Freddy was reading a discarded copy of Scientific American . The beetle landed on Willy 's sleeve and promptly located a gaping tear in the fabric , through which bare arm showed . Willy raised his other hand menacingly . “ Do n't , ” Freddy barked , causing Willy to jump with enough force to dislodge the beetle . “ Aw , Freddy , ” Willy whined , “ why dintcha lemme kill it ? What good 's a stupid bug ? ” “ That would have been a rather unfortunate kill , Willy , by your bare hand on your bare arm . You must learn to be cognizant of our insect friends and insect enemies. ” “ So what 's he , poison or sumpin '? ” “ Unpleasant , at least , ” Freddy said . “ That was a blister beetle ; smash it on your arm and you 'll grow a nice welt . A member of the Meloidae family. ” “ You mean bugs have families and all , too ? ” Willy asked . “ Beetle ‘ families ’ are groupings of similar species of insects , ” Freddy explained . “ Not actually kinfolk . For instance , this beetle is related to the Lytta vesicatoria of southern Europe , more commonly known as the — ” Freddy glanced out of the corner of his eye at Oscar , hoping to shield the next bit of information from his perverted brain , and whispered the name . Willy 's eyes widened . “ Hey , Oscar , ” he hollered , jumping up . “ You hear what Freddy said ? That bug I almost swatted 's practically a Spanish Fly ! ” “ Which way 'd he go ? ” Oscar squeaked , allowing his collection of stubs to scatter as he hopped around , looking on and under and behind the bench for the escaping insect . “ Hold it , hold it , ” Freddy commanded , trying to restore order . “ I said it 's like it , not IS it . It does n't have what it takes , so skip it , huh ? ” Willy and Oscar sat down again . “ Freddy , ” Willy sighed with adoration , “ how 'd ya ever get so smart ? I mean , bein ’ a bum and all ? ” “ I keep telling you guys ; I went to nothing but the finest universities . Well , except toward the end , when I was getting desperate , I guess I was n't so choosy. ” “ Aw , g ' wan now , Freddy . Collitches cost money , and you 're as poor as the rest of us . Bummin ’ for a cuppa coffee , and all the time talking about Yale , and Oxford , and Hah-vad. ” “ What would you say , Willy , if I told you that once I belonged to the richest family in Mississippi ? ” “ I 'd say Mississippi was a pretty poor state , ” Willy said , and Oscar giggled . “ I once was Frederik Van Smelt , spoiled son of the wealthy shrimp and oyster scion . And there 's nothing as bad , my father said , as spoiled Smelt . He disowned me , of course . I owned six Cadillacs — one right after the other , I wrecked them all . I traveled all over the world and probably counteracted a billion dollars ’ worth of foreign aid . I was kicked out of the best schools in the world. ” “ How come if you 're so smart you flunked out of all them schools ? ” Oscar asked . “ Me ? Flunked out ? I never made less than an A in any course I took during my eight years at war with college . I was expelled from nine schools and barely escaped the highway patrol when I was bootlegging at Oklahoma University ! ” “ Freddy , ” Willy said , “ you 're lyin ’ like a dog , butcha make it sound s ’ real ! ” Jones squirmed uncomfortably in his seat in the briefing room , phrasing and rephrasing his thoughts . It seemed that no matter which arrangement of words he chose , it still was going to be obvious that he 'd flopped . He re-examined his fingernails and selected one which was still long enough to chew . General Marcher concluded his current appraisal of the situation and began calling on the various individuals with whom certain phases of OPERATION SPACE CASE had been entrusted . Jones groaned as each arose and gave favorable progress reports . “ The pod is completed and has been tested , sir . It will by no means be plush , but it will be sufficiently comfortable even for the long voyage to Ganymede. ” “ The guidance system is perfected to the extent that we need. ” “ There are no further deceleration problems to be solved. ” “ The crash program has been approved for the two-way rocket ; it is on the drawing board and current estimates are that the envoy can be brought back in three years. ” “ Ganymede has replied to our last message ; a suitable artificial environment will be available for the envoy. ” “ Personnel Specialist Jones ? ” Carlton gave his chin a final sweaty rub and slowly rose to his feet . “ General Marcher , sir , ” he choked , “ I 'm ... we 're ... experiencing a little difficulty finding a volunteer , so far — ” “ Negative perspiration on that count , Jones , ” the Project Officer interrupted . “ The draft has never been abolished ; we can grab anyone you put your finger on ! Now , who will it be ? ” “ Sir , it does n't seem to be that so much as ... well ... sir , has any consideration been given to perhaps sending a delegation rather than a single envoy ? ” The general smiled broadly . “ Now , that is more like it ! I take it you mean you have a number of equally-qualified persons who have expressed an intense desire to go to Ganymede , and there is no way to impartially select one of these men over the others ? This is commendable . However , our space limitation clearly precludes sending more than one person . I 'm afraid you will just have to make your choice from a hat. ” Jones turned a trifle redder . “ That 's not exactly the problem , either , sir. ” The general 's smile wilted and became a frozen frown . “ Just exactly what are you trying to say , Jones ? ” “ There 's no one who can meet the qualifications , sir , ” Jones said , feeling sick at his stomach . “ Are you telling me that in the entire United States , there is not one person who has a basic understanding of the twenty-four major fields ? ” “ I 'm afraid that 's right , sir. ” “ See me after the briefing , Jones . I 'm certain that the Foremost Personnel Specialist in the United States must have some further ideas on this matter. ” Jones sank slowly back into his seat and covered his face with his hands . “ I 'm a goner , ” he whispered to himself . “ Jones , you can be replaced. ” Dwindle , sitting on his left , suddenly punched him vigorously in the ribs . “ Say , Mr. Jones , ” he rattled , “ I just thought of a great idea. ” “ Tell it to the general , ” Jones moaned . “ Maybe then he 'll realize what a handicap I 've been working under. ” “ Hi ya , Freddy , ” Willy said , sitting down on the bench and helping himself to some peanuts . “ Workin ’ a crossword puzzle ? ” Freddy pocketed his pencil stub and laid aside the newspaper . “ Naw , not this time . Just playing around with one of those ‘ We 're looking for bright young men ’ ads. ” “ Freddy ! Y ' ai n't thinkin ’ a gettin ’ a JOB ? ” “ Nothing like that , ” Freddy laughed . “ Just , exercising my mind . Filling out one of those little tests they always have . Helps keep a fella sharp , you know. ” “ Yeh , I seen the kind . Like what has pictures and you 're supposed to find things wrong in the picture like dames with beards and dogs with six feet ? ” “ Kinda like that , only this one 's all written and is a little tougher . You 're supposed to send the answers in and whoever has good answers gets to take a tougher test and whoever does good on that test gets the job . Probably selling neckties on the corner or something. ” “ No kiddin '. That what it says ? ” “ Just says ‘ handsome rewards , ’ but that 's probably close to it. ” “ You gonna send it in ? ” Willy asked . “ Naw , I just fill ‘ em out for fun , like I said . Can you imagine me peddling neckties on the corner ? ” “ Then how d ' ya know if you got the right answers ? ” “ Hell , I know the answers , ” Freddy bragged . “ Like I said , this is just exercise . Mental gymnastics . Like this last one ; it was pretty tough compared to most of them . Had some questions about things I had n't even thought about since college , things I 'd forgotten I knew . What good 's an education if you forget what things you know ? ” “ That 's why I never bothered , ” Willy agreed . “ ' Cause I never could remember things so good. ” “ No , Willy . You 've got it all wrong . I still know it , I just did n't know I know it. ” “ Aw , Freddy , ” Willy said unhappily . “ You 're pullin ’ my leg again ! ” “ Suit yourself , ” Freddy smiled . “ Hold down the bench for me , O. K .? I 'll be right back. ” Willy watched Freddy until he went into the little brick building in the center of the park , and then grabbed Freddy 's newspaper and scampered over to Oscar 's bench . “ Hey , you know how Freddy 's always talkin ’ big about how much he knows , ” Willy said breathlessly . “ I got an idea how to call his bluff . He filled out one of these tests and says he knows all the answers . Let 's send it in and see if he 's as smart as he says ! ” “ Yeh ! That 's great , Willy ! ” Then Oscar 's face darkened . “ Wonder where we can steal a stamp ? ” “ That was a pretty good idea of mine , about advertising in the paper , was n't it , Mr. Jones ? ” Dwindle , America 's Number One Personnel Specialist , asked his surly assistant . “ Yes , Dwindle. ” Jones stared gloomily out the fourteenth story window into the park , where the local bums were loafing and sleeping and feeding peanuts to the pigeons . He was nauseated with the prospect of having to address his new boss as “ Mr. Dwindle , ” and was toying with the idea of abandoning his specialty completely to join the ranks of the happy , carefree unemployed . He watched as two uniformed policemen approached one of the less wholesome-appearing characters . “ No , I do n't suppose I could tolerate being in and out of jail every week on a vagrancy charge , ” he told himself . But then he smiled bitterly as he thought of the strange parallel between the policemen arresting the bum and other officials , elsewhere in the United States , tapping respectable citizens on the shoulder at this very moment . “ Dwindle , do you really think it was wise to issue warrants to arrest all those persons who scored perfect on the first test ? How many did you say there were ? ” “ Only a hundred or so , ” Dwindle smiled sweetly . “ And besides , they 're not being arrested . General Marcher explained to you that they are being drafted into the service of the government . Honestly , sometimes I think you worry too much. ” Jones turned back to the window , brooding over Dwindle 's transformation . “ Maybe so , ” he sighed , watching the newly-arrested vagrant pointing an accusing finger toward one of the other bums . Willy strained and twisted , trying to reclaim his arm from the policeman 's grip . “ Honest , you guys . I did n't know it was against the law . Aw , I figgered it was against the rules mebbe to send in somebody else 's answers , but we wuz only makin ’ a joke , Oscar ‘ n ’ me . Oscar 's the one who actual put it in the mailbox and stole the stamp ! I bet he 's the one you 're after ! ” “ Now calm down , Willy , ” the beefy policeman coaxed . “ No one 's broken any law . Nobody 's under arrest . We just want to chat a minute with whoever it was filled out that test. ” “ Yeh , Willy , ” the second policeman broke in , “ if you did n't do it , and I believe you when you say you did n't , then who did ? ” “ What 's it to ya ? ” Willy asked , his mouth twitching nervously . The first policeman glanced at the second and then back at Willy . “ Well , it 's like this , Willy , ” he said . “ Whoever filled out those answers got every one of them right . The people who run the contest want to meet the guy , see ? And they asked us to help find him because we know you people better than anyone else does . See ? That 's all ! ” “ Yeh , ” said the second . “ That 's all . Now who did it ? ” Willy stood with his jaw drooping for a moment . “ You mean he got ever ’ last one of ‘ em right ? ” he asked . “ Freddy was always braggin ’ about his brains , but me ‘ n ’ Oscar figgered he was makin ’ most of it up. ” “ Freddy who ? Freddy the Fish you mean ? ” “ Yeh , Freddy. ” Willy perked up and turned toward Freddy 's bench . “ Hey , Freddy ! Hey , you know that test you took in the newspaper that you did n't know I sent in ? You won the contest or sumpin '! Hey , that 's great ! ” Jones and Dwindle watched the draftees file into the examination room . “ I still do n't see how this is going to solve the problem , ” Jones frowned . “ I believe it will , ” Dwindle contradicted him . “ Specialists in each of the major fields have been consulted , and each provided fifty questions. ” “ The hardest questions they could think up , I imagine. ” “ No , not at all . The purpose is to provide comprehensive coverage of each field . And each question is of the type that , if the examinee knows the answer , it can be reasonably assumed that he knows quite a bit in that particular phase of the field . For instance , if he knows what enzyme is associated with the stomach , he probably knows what enzyme is associated with the liver. ” “ I know one big problem you 're going to run into , ” Jones sulked . “ Just like the IBM cards . You 're going to find one guy who clobbers the Electronics part of the test but completely busts out in History and everything else. ” “ I do n't think so , ” Dwindle said . “ The preliminary test will have taken care of that . It was designed so that , in order to answer every question right , a person would have to have at least a rudimentary knowledge of all twenty-four major fields. ” As Jones was considering whether it would be better to slit his own throat or Dwindle 's , General Marcher entered the room and approached . “ Excellent . Excellent , ” the general declared . “ A very distinguished-looking group you 've assembled here , Dwindle . Hello , Jones. ” “ Yes , sir , ” Dwindle said , “ with the possible exception of the seedy chap in the rear. ” Jones looked to the rear of the room , and his eyes bugged . Freddy the Fish , clean-shaven but tattered , was alternately wetting the pencil lead in his mouth and eating peanuts . “ That 's the bum who feeds sparrows in the park ! ” Jones gasped . “ How did he get out of jail so quick ? I saw a couple of policemen haul him off just a day or so ago. ” “ This is where they hauled him to , ” General Marcher said . “ It just so happens that he answered every question right on the preliminary examination . He says his name 's Freddy Smith , although I doubt that he could prove it. ” “ He says he never had a father , ” Dwindle added . “ Says his family was too poor. ” Jones stared at General Marcher , then stared at Dwindle , then turned and stared at Freddy the Fish , who had just left his seat and was ambling toward the trio . “ Looks like he 's throwing in the towel , ” Jones , said happily . “ He 's bringing his paper with him. ” “ Maybe he just wants clarification on a question , ” Dwindle said . “ I 'm all done , ” Freddy said . “ Who gets this ? ” “ Go ahead , Dwindle , ” Carlton Jones smirked . “ Grade the man 's paper . He 's all done. ” Dwindle smiled uncertainly . “ You 're allowed all the time you need , Mr. Smith. ” “ Oh , that 's O. K . I 'm done. ” Dwindle produced his red pencil and the answer sheet which had 1 , 200 small circles punched in it . He sat down , placed the key over the test paper , and began searching for white spaces showing through . “ That 's the last one , sir , ” Dwindle said six hours later as he added the one hundred twelfth graded test to the neat stack at the left of his desk . He stared through the thousand-plus holes in the answer key as if expecting the holes to shift . “ And still no change in the standings ? ” General Marcher asked again . “ Mr. Smith still has the best grade , ” Dwindle answered . “ The percentages again ? ” the general asked . “ Over all , ninety-six per cent for Mr. Smith , ” Dwindle said for the fourth time . “ His lowest percentage in any one category was eighty per cent . The next highest score was by Dr. Schmelling , who had seventy-eight per cent , but he failed in six categories . The third highest score was by Dr. Ranson , seventy-six per cent , failing in seven categories . The fourth highest score was — ” “ Enough . Enough , ” General Marcher interrupted . “ I think we 've found our man , do n't you , Dwindle ? ” “ I hope we do n't have to use pressure , sir , ” Dwindle replied . Jones turned from the window , from which he was observing the bums in the park . “ How can you possibly consider such a thing , ” he blurted , “ as to send a penniless , unemployed , dirty , ragged tramp to Ganymede as the United States ’ Number One emissary ? ” “ Jones , perhaps I 'd best clarify a point or two for you , ” General Marcher said in measured tones . “ We 've been searching the nation over , seeking a man who can fulfill our exacting requirements . We have found that man . There is no doubt in my mind that Mr. Smith possesses the greatest single store of knowledge about this planet and its people . So far as I 'm concerned , which is considerable , it does n't matter that this man has chosen the way of a philosopher instead of seeking an occupation . It does n't matter that he lacks the necessary status to be listed on your IBM cards . It does n't matter that you failed to find this man , because Dwindle succeeded . And , it does n't matter whether I ever see you again ! ” “ Yes , sir , ” Jones said , and picked up his hat and left . “ Now , back to the business at hand , Dwindle . You say these prospects do n't know the reasons behind the test ? ” “ That is correct , sir . I feared there might be some temptation for the prospects to not do their best , if they knew that success might result in their being removed from the face of the Earth. ” “ Wise . Then I suggest we approach Mr. Smith on the idea , cautiously , to determine his sentiments . If he does n't want to go , of course , we 've got to draft him. ” Freddy cracked the peanut , put half in his mouth and tossed the other half to the sparrows . “ I might be going away for a while , Willy , ” he said , ending a rather long silence . “ You ai n't gettin ’ a job , are ya Freddy ? ” “ Watch yer language , ” Oscar scolded . “ Naw , not really a job . At least not the kind you think of . Sort of an all-expense-paid vacation , with a change of scenery. ” “ Ya ai n't had a run-in with the bulls , have ya ? ” the stricken Willy asked . “ Me ? You know me better , Willy . Nothing like that . And I 'm not even sure the thing will pan out , but you know all those newspaper stories about messages from another planet ? ” “ Yeh ! Yeh ! Ya read it to me ! ” Willy jabbered excitedly . “ And that test I took that you sent in and the fellas talked to me about ? ” “ Yeh ! Say , I hope that did n't make you trouble , Freddy , ‘ cuz me ‘ n ’ Oscar was just kinda jokin ', see , and — ” “ It 's O. K ., Willy . Well , one of the fellas I talked to was General Marcher , who 's been mentioned in the newspaper stories in connection with ... here , Willy , take these , ” he interrupted himself when he saw the two men approaching . “ See that new guy at the bench over yonder ? Give him these peanuts . I think he 'd like to feed my sparrows while I 'm gone . Name 's Jones , and he 'll probably be around for a spell. ” Freddy stood up to greet the two arrivals . “ Hello , general , ” he said , tipping his battered cap . “ It 's about the trip to Ganymede , I suppose ? ”
